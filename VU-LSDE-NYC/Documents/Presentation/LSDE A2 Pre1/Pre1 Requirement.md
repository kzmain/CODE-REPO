1. you must have done a _**quick-scan**_ of the data and have extracted interesting statistics on it, as well as have created some graphs on these (show them in the presentation). Please provide some notion of interpretation this data (is it high-quality, is there noise/rubbish? can you answer the research question with data?)
2. what _**data product will you create**_ in order to answer your research questions? What needs to be done to reshape your input data sources into this data product? Will you involve additional data sources?
3. what _**kind of analysis**_ do you want to do (algorithms, data structures). Explain relevant previous approaches to this, preferably from  related papers.
what (cluster) tools do you plan to use, and why? Explain relevant features of the tool you chose to use, possibly from a related paper.
4. _**what kind of visualizations**_ would you create?
5. _**time-plan, and work distribution**_
