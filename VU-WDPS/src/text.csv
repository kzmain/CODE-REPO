clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,You ever think about what is in your back yard?
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Might seem like a bit of an odd question, but its one thats been on my mind recently."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Its really pretty easy for me to answer.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Weve got a fort for the kids to play on, a slide and a little house for the younger ones, some lawn furniture, a grill, and a small patio."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Seems pretty typical, doesnt it?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Now, if I just stopped there, this would make for a pretty pointless and stupid post, so Im not going to."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Whats interesting to me are the things that I didnt describe that are back there, things that I dont expect or want you to see."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,We have a new dog thats still a bit of a puppy
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,and she likes to drag things out the dog door and into the backyard.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,She doesnt typically chew them up (except for shoes)
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,she just takes them outside and deposits them between the fort and the back door.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,One day my wife and I were talking while I was driving home from work
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"and she said, Dont look in the back yard when you get home."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Naturally, I was curious why I was being restricted like this and"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"she replied with, Because it looks like a diaper bomb went off out there."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Apparently Maggie had found a trash can in the bedroom where we had been putting diapers and was taking them outside, one by one."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Now you might be wondering
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,why Im telling you about this and how it relates to my point.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"You really need to be less like my son watching a movie, constantly asking about whats going to happen, and be more patient."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Im only 250 words into this.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"When there is stuff strewn all over the back yard, I hate going out there."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Its surrounded by a fence
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,so nobody sees it and this removes just about any motivation I might have to clean it up.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,I dont even like mowing out there.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Normally, nobody knows about this except for my family and its not a big deal."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"However, last week, anyone driving by my house knew about my lack of back yard cleanliness."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"After a couple days of strong winds and one good storm, my already pathetic fence gave up on one side of the house and came crashing down."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,I look outside during the storm and notice three fence panels on the ground and two more waving like fans at a football game who just realized the camera was turned their direction.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"I was understandably disappointed that I would have to repair the fence, but I was more disturbed that now people would be able to see into my back yard and the sorry state it was in."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Last weekend while I was rebuilding the fence, I had plenty of time to think."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,I started to realize that the way we maintain our house could really be a metaphor for our own lives.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"I try to make sure that the front yard is fairly well kept, always mowed and looking at least presentable."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,The front yard is like my public life.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Its lived out in front of anyone who can see it and what goes on there isnt hidden in the least.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Any words I speak in public are out there for all to hear.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,My back yard is a bit more guarded.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"I try to keep what is going on back there private, but it doesnt always work, as evidenced by my fence falling in."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Just like that fence, sometimes my guard is down and people see a bit more of what Im really like."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,I might try to quickly build the fence back up
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"but once someone sees that back yard of my personality, they probably wont forget it, especially if it contradicts what I normally do."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"My point behind all this is that we need to be sure that what we display in the front yard of our lives, our public face, is consistent with how we live in the back yard of our life."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"We expect privacy there, but we should also understand that at any moment that privacy can be broken, and all the things that we try to hide from public view will be displayed for all to see."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Luke 12:2-3 tells us:
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,2

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Let us live our lives so that what is proclaimed from the housetops is our love for our Savior, our dedication to living our lives for the calling He has given to us."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"We are the light of the world, shining like that city on a hill to make known His sacrifice for us, not for our own glory, but for His."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Pray that we do not let the hidden part of our lives become a hindrance to the spreading of His word.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,TIGA (The Independent Game Developers Association) has been fighting with the UK government over tax breaks for the gaming industry.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"According to the New York Times, Because video game makers straddle the lines between software development, the entertainment industry and online retailing, they can combine tax breaks in ways that companies like Netflix and Adobe cannot."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"But this isnt the case in the UK, meaning that many UK developers are emigrating, heading to countries which provide those types of incentives."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,Rocksteady designer Sefton Hill has described this as a talent-drain for the UK gaming industry.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"In an interview with CVG, Hill was asked whether or not he thought the UK could be competitive with countries like the US with regard to gaming."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"In that sense, I can rationalize the existence of a game like King Arthur II, despite my dislike for games of its philosophy."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"Still, this is clearly not as profound a package as a Total War game, and it shows through the games presentation and gameplay."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,Blizzard recently filed a complaint against Valve in an attempt to gain control of DOTA and all related names.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,"DOTA, or Defense of the Anicents, began as a mod in Blizzards popular RTS, Warcraft 3."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,Warcraft IIIs EULA clearly specifies that all underlying intellectual property rights in and to Warcraft III are owned by Blizzard:

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,Youll have at least one extra post and one extra page in Wordpress due to the fact that Wordpress automatically generates a welcome post and sample page when its first installed.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,The reason you have to do this is that Blogger does crazy things with their permalink structure.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"In order to minimize the number of broken links, youll need to change the permalink structure in Wordpress to match the crazy setup in Blogger."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,This will cause most of the links to work properly and minimize the number of broken links.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,Note:
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"This will minimize the number of broken links, but it wont eliminate them entirely."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"This is due to the fact that Blogger removes articles such as a, an, and the from urls for post titles and Wordpress does not."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Because of this, a post with a title such as, The Absolute Best Way to Start a Wordpress Blog, will have a url that looks like www.yourdomain.com/absolute-best-way-start-wordpress-blog in Blogger and www.yourdomain.com/the-absolute-best-way-to-start-a-wordpress-blog in Wordpress."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"If you are reading this blog, there is no doubt that you have ordered something from Amazon.com from the comforts of your desktop or laptop computer."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Today, it is only slightly less likely that you have ordered something from Amazon from your phone."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Im no exception.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Yesterday, I ordered a pair of ear buds on my iPhone from Amazon in between the time my dental hygienist cleaned my teeth and the dentist came in to give me the verdict."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,We asked our Crazy Egg Design and Marketing Experts to analyze the Amazon mobile website design.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Take a hard look yourself, read through our opinions and, if you are so inclined, give us your analysis in the comments below."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,1.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Using a simple one column structure as a list view for the interface.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Adding multi column structures for any small mobile device makes the entire real estate feel crammed and harder to use.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,2.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Keeping things simple by introducing high level functions and options that are most important such as: search, cart, wish list, streamlined menus."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,3.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Information for the product is minimal to start, but if user is interested, they can go to the next layout with more details."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Biggest mistake most people make is providing too much copy/content on one screen, especially for mobile."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,4. Option to use full site at the bottom.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Providing the user the option to choose experience is important.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,5.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Graphics, colors, and overall aesthetics are clean and minimal  which help performance and keep maintenance costs lower."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The user experience for the Amazon Mobile site should be very simple; make it as easy as possible for someone to find a product and complete a purchase.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"This successfully achieves that, and by focusing on the most popular product categories (Books, Kindle, Movies and Electronics)"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,it can keep the navigation as intuitive as possible.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Im also really happy to see that they offer a clear link to the Amazon.com full site.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Its amazing how many mobile sites dont do this.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The Amazon mobile home page is a great example of a mobile optimized website.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Its easy to navigate and gives the user what they are looking for right away  
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,the amazon search bar.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The ad below the search bar for Amazon Apps doesnt appear to be an ad at all and is, very likely, the reason the user navigated to Amazon on their mobile device in the first place."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The mobile site seems easy to navigate since appears very similar to the regular website.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The cart is at the top, always reminding you how many items you have so far and the search bar and department categories are easy to navigate as well."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"~ Angela Jones, Design By Ange.la"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Amazon are usability experts.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Their website isnt the prettiest thing out there, nor is their mobile site, but they do an amazing job of getting users to the products they want!"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I buy just about everything I own from Amazon
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,and I do that not only because of pricing but because it can be easier to find it on Amazon than my local retail outlet.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Retailers, are you listening?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Given how much attention Amazon pays to what users are doing on their site, they most likely took their top categories and made them easily accessible."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The arrows on the buttons are great functional suggestions.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I can tell that if I push Books the page is going to slide down in an accordion effect and I can tell that if I push See All Departments Im going to head off to another screen.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This is very effective in letting the user know whats going to happen.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,To the savvy user it lets you know what you can do with a spotty 3G/4G connection and what you may want to wait for a more stable connection to do.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I love how the account specific and sub-categories are styled differently.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This style change lets me know that these choices are specific to me
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,and/or my account.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Finally, the best part of all, FULL SITE!"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I cant tell you how many poor mobile sites
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Ive been to where the experience was
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,so lacking I wanted to go to the full site.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,You know what those poor mobile sites all have in common?
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,They dont let you go to the full site!
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,A+ to Amazon for giving me the freedom to choose.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The site looks very clean and easy to use.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The theme matches the www.amazon.com theme and helps promote the websites branding.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The two containers (blue and yellow) have different styles.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The blue one has rounded corners and is smaller in width than the yellow one  which has square corners.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,It might be more consistent if they were both the same style unless they are supposed to be separated.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,From the screenshot it is unclear as to whether the department list is used when a search is done (as is the case on the www.amazon.com).
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This is mainly due to having advertisement in between the search field and the department list.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The Cart and Wishlist links are duplicated once up the top and once down the bottom.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Given that mobile screen space is limited, one set should be removed."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This is a very useful mobile page.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"It has most of the features of the main site, in a smaller format with quick links to get to the most popular items."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"I would guess that Amazon has research or analytics telling them which categories are essential to show on this page, so I trust their judgment."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"I could nitpick some stuff (like wasting so much height on the ad for the Kindle Fire ensuring that anyone on an iPhone will never see the menus without scrolling down first), but I said I wouldnt nitpick"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,so Ill stop.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The great thing about the Amazon Mobile home page design is the fact that it is a simple design that one can identify as Amazon just by the fonts and colors.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The use of the viewable space (before you would have to scroll below the fold) is great.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The subtle placement of deals below the logo is pretty sly, plus having the button to promote the mobile app below the search bar is a great idea."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The end user may find it easier to download the app and have it readily available then have to navigate to Amazon each time through the phones browser.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The Amazon mobile home page does an impressive job of presenting their large and complex navigation into a scaled down intuitive menu.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The order and use of different colors for the primary and secondary menus helps provide visual clarity.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"I like that theyve featured search and their mobile app at the top of the page, since those are likely top actions for mobile users."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The blue primary accent color leaves orange
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,(opposite on the color wheel) as the optimal CTA color which they implemented fairly well.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"On the improvement note, links on the page need an audit check for adequate text size and padding to ensure theyre easily clickable."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,(Tip: Your pinky nail can work as a handy mobile sizing/spacing guide for links since its mostly likely the size of the your index fingers pressable surface area.)
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This is a very decent way to show the most popular navigation options.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Im sure that Amazon tested this pretty thoroughly before concluding what people would click on most.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The only thing Id like if I were to use that application is that the advertisement was further down underneath the departments.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,It seems more intuitive to have them directly underneath the search box instead.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"I think the Amazon homepage has struck an excellent balance between easy navigation to a lot of different places (which is absolutely necessary, given the complexity of the site), and showcasing the product that they are currently trying to push (currently the Kindle Fire)."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The guideline that Id take away from this design
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"is that first you want to put front and center in front of your audience whatever you want them to see, and then immediately give them access to anything that they might be looking for."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"First, I think it is clear that getting the word out about Kindle Fire is a primary goal of Amazons."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I like the way the product is featured with an image and a clear call-to-action without trying to say too much on the mobile home page.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"If you want to know more, click the Learn More link."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Secondly, it is clear that it has been detected that I am using an iPhone to reach the mobile version of the website."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This has caused the mobile home page to display a call-to-action to download their iPhone applications.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Lastly, the navigation is brilliantly organized which is no small feat for a company that sells the wide array of products that Amazon sells."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,They list the most popular departments on the home page and then a link to See All Departments if you dont find what you are looking for.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This allows them to serve the majority of people without cluttering up the mobile interface with links.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,We know that many of our readers are experts in design and marketing as well.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,We would love to hear your critique of the Amazon Mobile Home Page in the comments!
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I think the navigation is great.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,And the color scheme is transcendent of their desktop version.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Amazons branding is their usability digitally at least.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,They are missing a huge oppertunity to harness that same gut feeling through their TV and print media

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Engaging voters online is an increasingly important part of the electoral process.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,The 2008 Presidential campaign saw Barack Obama and the Democratic Party rightly complimented for their effective use of web technology and social media.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"As the Republican presidential primary campaign continues, has the GOP learned some of those lessons?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,How are the four remaining candidates portraying themselves online?
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Romney makes a big mistake immediately by hiding his main website behind a very mundane splash page.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"The splash page is intended to encourage people to sign up for updates about the campaign, and the need for any candidate to develop a strong user list is important."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,But this call to action could easily have been incorporated into the main site; right now the first experience anyone has visiting Romneys campaign site is a mediocre and unattractive extra-step.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Im sure its going to put off a lot of visitors.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Once you get past the splash page, Romney has a pretty appealing site."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"The layout is strong, and makes really effective use of imagery."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Good use of white space gives a clean and professional look.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Its easy to find more about Romney and his stance on the issues, as well as latest campaign news."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Its also the only site that provides really visible links to state specific information for all 50 states.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,I like the very clear calls to action for the main social media services.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Facebook, Twitter and Google+ options to share major stories are seamlessly integrated, and there are separate options for engaging with the candidate directly on social media."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"This suggests a clear understanding that theres a distinction between building social media followers, and sharing content."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Gingrichs site scores highly for usability, but doesnt have a really strong visual impact."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Its well put together but very traditional in its layout and appearance.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Kind of like a very standard blog template  
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,and that means it looks dated.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Navigation is simple, and there are very clear calls to action for anyone interested in getting involved with the campaign, donating, or buying campaign related merchandise."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Social media seems very much an afterthought (surprising, given that Gingrich has a massive Twitter following compared to any of the other candidates)."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,It also looks like some areas of the site arent updated often enough.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"As I write this, there are still sections on helping Gingrich win in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary, both events that happened a couple of weeks ago."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Ron Pauls the only candidate using WordPress for his campaign website (all the other candidates use Drupal).
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Initial engagement is strong.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"I really like his donation thermometer with a real time count, and the recent donor helps to suggest that the Paul campaign engages with individual people."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,It makes for a powerful call to action for donations.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,I was confused navigating around the site.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"The two columns of articles on the front page (one is an opinion-based Paulitical Ticker, the other is Ron Paul in the News)"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,arent very well differentiated.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"The navigation bar has too many options, and the different sections of the site could be more clearly defined."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Social media integration is relatively low key, and the site is generally more wordy than the others (as, indeed, Paul is as a candidate)."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"I think it would benefit from a larger font size, its fallen into the 12 pixel trap that might look OK at first glance but isnt that well suited to easily browsing text."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,I just dont like this website.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"The layout is odd, and looks very strange in larger windows; its like theyve tried to create a fluid width layout without really understanding the principle."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Its blocky, a little ugly, and has bad typography."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Add in a lack of any clear call to action, and Im unsure what the site is trying to achieve."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Even the language is a little unusual, with some sections written in the third person and some sections written in the first person."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,It gives the feeling of a made by committee website that doesnt have any strong creative vision or sense of purpose.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Of all the primary candidate websites, Santorums is the one that looks the most amateurish."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,The first time it took me a few moments to work out where the navigation was; the site layout works in such a way as to completely draw the eye away from that menu.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Its clear that the leading GOP candidates have upped their game and understand the importance of a good website (former candidates John Huntsman, Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Michelle Bachmann also have reasonably polished sites)."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,Theres still a lot of room to improve.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"None of the sites use any HTML 5 technology, their SEO is basic, and none of the design is particularly outstanding."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"The GOP candidates may have taken some steps to improve their online presence, but they have a long way to go."
