clueweb12-0000tw-00-00006,thegoodlife.info,"        Someone once said: ""you can't get it right the first time"" and he was right. I did commit mistakes, some of which were costly, before I was able to publish my first electronic book. In this article, it's my aim to help you at least minimize those mistakes so you can make the whole thing manageable."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,Whats in your back yard?
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Im on vacation this week, so Im posting some older articles. Hope you enjoy this one."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"You ever think about what is in your back yard? Might seem like a bit of an odd question, but its one thats been on my mind recently. Its really pretty easy for me to answer. Weve got a fort for the kids to play on, a slide and a little house for the younger ones, some lawn furniture, a grill, and a small patio. Seems pretty typical, doesnt it?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Now, if I just stopped there, this would make for a pretty pointless and stupid post, so Im not going to. Whats interesting to me are the things that I didnt describe that are back there, things that I dont expect or want you to see. We have a new dog thats still a bit of a puppy and she likes to drag things out the dog door and into the backyard. She doesnt typically chew them up (except for shoes) she just takes them outside and deposits them between the fort and the back door. One day my wife and I were talking while I was driving home from work and she said, Dont look in the back yard when you get home. Naturally, I was curious why I was being restricted like this and she replied with, Because it looks like a diaper bomb went off out there. Apparently Maggie had found a trash can in the bedroom where we had been putting diapers and was taking them outside, one by one."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Now you might be wondering why Im telling you about this and how it relates to my point. You really need to be less like my son watching a movie, constantly asking about whats going to happen, and be more patient. Im only 250 words into this."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"When there is stuff strewn all over the back yard, I hate going out there. Its surrounded by a fence so nobody sees it and this removes just about any motivation I might have to clean it up. I dont even like mowing out there. Normally, nobody knows about this except for my family and its not a big deal. However, last week, anyone driving by my house knew about my lack of back yard cleanliness. After a couple days of strong winds and one good storm, my already pathetic fence gave up on one side of the house and came crashing down. I look outside during the storm and notice three fence panels on the ground and two more waving like fans at a football game who just realized the camera was turned their direction. I was understandably disappointed that I would have to repair the fence, but I was more disturbed that now people would be able to see into my back yard and the sorry state it was in."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Last weekend while I was rebuilding the fence, I had plenty of time to think. I started to realize that the way we maintain our house could really be a metaphor for our own lives. I try to make sure that the front yard is fairly well kept, always mowed and looking at least presentable. The front yard is like my public life. Its lived out in front of anyone who can see it and what goes on there isnt hidden in the least. Any words I speak in public are out there for all to hear."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"My back yard is a bit more guarded. I try to keep what is going on back there private, but it doesnt always work, as evidenced by my fence falling in. Just like that fence, sometimes my guard is down and people see a bit more of what Im really like. I might try to quickly build the fence back up but once someone sees that back yard of my personality, they probably wont forget it, especially if it contradicts what I normally do."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"My point behind all this is that we need to be sure that what we display in the front yard of our lives, our public face, is consistent with how we live in the back yard of our life. We expect privacy there, but we should also understand that at any moment that privacy can be broken, and all the things that we try to hide from public view will be displayed for all to see. Luke 12:2-3 tells us:"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"2 For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be known. 3 Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00007,claywginn.com,"Let us live our lives so that what is proclaimed from the housetops is our love for our Savior, our dedication to living our lives for the calling He has given to us. We are the light of the world, shining like that city on a hill to make known His sacrifice for us, not for our own glory, but for His. Pray that we do not let the hidden part of our lives become a hindrance to the spreading of His word."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,The journey from your mind into your hands is shorter than youre thinking.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Be careful if you think you stand, you just might be sinking."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"The hard thing about trying to be a good, moral person is that youre constantly being pulled towards those things you know you shouldnt be involved in. Temptation has a way of dragging you back onto the wide path when youve been trying to walk the straight and narrow."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Sometimes though, you make the choices yourself. You see that someone else is letting slide what you think is wrong, so you begin to think its OK too. It could be swearing, movies, drinking, just about anything. You start to feel pressure if youre the one that is different from everyone else and then you begin to conform to the ways of those around you."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"The little things add up, all the time. First, you decide to tell a little white lie so that you dont get in trouble. You follow those with lies to cover up the original lie. Years later, youre telling your spouse that youve been at the office all day when really youve been at a bar, all because its become more natural to lie than to tell the truth."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Opening the door to any sin allows all sin to get a foothold in your life. Weve got to battle back sin with the Holy Spirit, actively engaging in the fight and not passively allowing the enemy to roll over us. This is something that doesnt come natural to any of us, it really is a struggle to do. However, the reward for fighting back the sin in our lives is eternal."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Imagine that a worker notices a problem with a dam holding back millions of gallons of water. Below that dam is a quaint little town, full of people going about their everyday lives. If the worker notices a small leak in the dam, should he fix the leak, or should he just say, Oh, its just a small leak, it should be fine. Those millions of gallons of water are now placing pressure on that small leak, causing it to grow a little bigger with each passing day."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Gradually, the leak turns into a gaping hole, allowing more water to pass through, causing some minor issues in the little town. Still, the worker says, The dam is still standing, that hole isnt causing much damage. Ill ignore it."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Eventually, the gaping hole gives way to an actual dam break. Millions of gallons of water are rushing down the hill towards the little town, destroying everything in its path. The little town is destroyed, all the people are injured or killed, and the dam worker justifies it by saying, The dam just broke!"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Now, lets talk about sin this way. Maybe youve allowed a little sin into your life, but you dont want to deal with it because its not a big deal. Everyone has small issues, right? Your family doesnt know about it and everything looks normal. However, that sin is placing pressure on you and on the rest of your life, wanting to allow more sin to come through."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Gradually, that sin grows into something that you and your family notice, but you dont really identify the cause of the problem. You continue to justify it by saying that everyone is doing it, itll be OK. Its not causing too many problems in your life so you just let it continue."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"Finally, the dam breaks. You act out on your sin in a big way, destroying your family, your reputation, and your relationship with God. You might say, I dont know what happened, I wasnt myself, it just happened!"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,"This is what happens when we allow sin to erode our life. Our familiarity with sin is unacceptable to God. We cannot be friendly with sin and friendly with God at the same time. Through prayer, through devotion to Him, God can give us the ability to overcome sin, but we have to make the effort to do so. We have to pursue God so that He can renew our minds."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00008,claywginn.com,Are there areas where you need to battle back sin in your life? How can I pray for you?

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"Its been quite a week. We have one more night here at Walt Disney World, then we are headed home. Ill give you a bit of a preview for next week though. There are a few things Ive noticed here that develop into great analogies for life lessons. Anything from a large, burly fellow with a pink Disney Princess backpack, to using the bathroom at the dinner table, to the lack of wisdom in crowds. I think youll enjoy these. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"However, today Id like to share with a you a few lessons that have been forcefully taught to me this week. Some painful, some really painful, and some rather enjoyable."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"I love that Ive been able to spend a week in a single hotel room with my wife and kids. However, Im going crazy spending a week in a single hotel room with my kids. Bedtime is the absolute craziest time of day. I dont know if it is the tired children, the tired parents, or the insanity of being in one room, but little ones do not go to sleep well this way, at least not ours. Now, this is a very first world problem, and I know that I should be thankful that Im able to take trips like this with my children. Dont misunderstand me, because I am very thankful for that. The simple fact remains that it is so far out of the ordinary for us as to be uncomfortable and even more tiring."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"The second thing Ive learned is that you can tell how many days people have been here just by the look on their faces. There is an unspoken Ive sat through ;Its A Small World so many times that i might just twist off at the next puppet I see look to some faces. These are the people that are not hardcore Disney fans, but came mostly for their children. (An aside: you know what would make Small World so much better? Bucket o softballs. Youll have to create a queue that would stretch all the way across the park for it. So many childhood doll nightmares erased in a hail of tossed balls. Its a goldmine. I expect my royalty checks to pour in soon.)"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"Too many people come here with the expectation that they can accomplish everything at WDW in a week. This is so far from the truth. My wife and I have been coming here since 1996, and weve still not seen or done it all. The likelihood is pretty slim that it will happen too. Too many things changing or disappearing to be able to conquer that mountain. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"The one lasting memory I have from our trips to WDW is the sense of awe that my children feel. Heck, I feel it too. Everything here is so much bigger, so much more perfect than the real world. Of course, if it werent that way, we wouldnt be paying to visit. If someone built a Computer Progeammer World, Id have to be drugged to be taken in to it. I dont want my real life, I want a different reality. That might be good sometimes, but it definitely isnt a way to live. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"Finally, it appears to me that while they are here, people become a clearer, more exact picture of themselves due to the money and time spent, and emotional and physical investment paid to be here. Vacations, especially big ones like WDW have a way of refining our personalities in a way that other experiences dont. Ive seen adults act like complete children and complete jerks. Ive seen children be perfect angels and ceaseless terrors (and you should have seen everyone elses kids, too). Im sure that I exhibit some of this too. We are who we are, and exhaustion makes the pretensions go away. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00009,claywginn.com,"All in all, its been a great time here. Im anxious to start home and return to my own reality though. Too many exciting things coming up in the next few weeks that I dont want to miss. I hope you come back again next week for my Observations on the World series."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00049,homemakersdaily.com,Can you imagine foods without any herbs or spices? Not a pleasant thought at all. Herbs and spices make our food taste delicious.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00049,homemakersdaily.com,"Its fun to experiment with different combinations and sometimes our experiments work and sometimes they dont. So in order to increase our chances for success as we experiment, Ive created a chart listing many of the common herbs and spices and how they can be used.

White pepper is slightly less spicy than black pepper. Its used to season bland, light colored foods such as eggs, cream soups and sauces  dishes which might not look so appetizing with specks of black pepper."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00049,homemakersdaily.com,"The difference between red pepper and paprika is that red pepper, also called cayenne pepper, is ground from dried chili peppers and is pungent and hot while paprika is ground from certain varieties of sweet red peppers and has a sweet flavor although it may be quite hot."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00051,homemakersdaily.com,"Warehouse shopping, such as at Costco and Sams, can be a great way to save money but it can also lead to the destruction of a good grocery budget. It all depends on how you shop there. First, lets look at the cost and benefits of a membership."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00051,homemakersdaily.com,"A membership to Sams costs $40 or $100 per year depending on the type of membership you chose. The Advantage membership is $40 and allows for 2 cardholders and the ability to purchase products in-store and online. The Advantage Plus is $100 and allows for 2 card holders, extended shopping hours, extra coupons and a percentage of savings on generic and name brand prescriptions."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00051,homemakersdaily.com,"Costos membership ranges from $55-$110 per year.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00051,homemakersdaily.com,Our family has a membership to Costco and we figured out that if we only bought milk there regularly we would pay for our membership 2.5x in a year with the amount we save!
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00051,homemakersdaily.com,"And now I want to tell you the secret to saving at warehouses. Are you listening very closely? Its all about what you buy and knowing your prices. Just because something is sold at a warehouse does NOT mean its a better deal than your neighborhood grocery store. You must look at the unit price to see if its a better deal. If you arent familiar with that term, unit price is figured by calculating the total price times the number of items the package contains. I often pull out my calculator and check unit prices while Im at Costco to compare it to what I know the grocery store price is to see if its a better deal."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00051,homemakersdaily.com,"Some people hesitate to shop at warehouses because the quantities are often so large. If you have room in your pantry or freezer and your family will consume something in reasonable time, then it might be well worth it. Another way to get around the large quantity is going in with a friend to split the purchase. My sister-in-law and I have"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00051,homemakersdaily.com,"shared huge packages of toilet paper, fruit and other things to help us both with our budgets and storage space."

His first appearance on Ellen then followed on May 26th where he first introduced his first single Broken Hearts, and at the same time Ellen DeGeneres announced a brilliant idea which was to launch her new record label eleveneleven. Greysons performance during the show captivated her heart. Later on, a new deal was born between Greyson, eleveneleven by Ellen DeGeneres and Interscope Records. His way to rock world music industry is now wide open. It is not only Ellen who was stunned by the talented 14 year old boy, as after the show, Greysons name buzzed in the world of social media. Not to mention the fans of his You Tube channel, but respectable names in entertainment also tagged his performance, such as: RyanSeacrest.com, Video Ga Ga, Yahoo! Music Videos blog, Asthon Kutcher, The Huffington Post, Los Angeles Times, ABC World News, Wall Street Journel, David Archuleta, and others. Later on, Guy Oseary, and LA Based entertainment managers who also managed Madonna, Demi Moore and Asthon Kutcher, recommended Greysons video on twitter, and is now is Greysons manager.His debut single Waiting Outside the Lines was released to iTunes on October 26, 2010. His first tour called Waiting4U tour in USA started on April 9, 2010 also performing with Cody Simpson, an Australian pop singer.

The songs in his album as filled with soaring violins and Greysons piano melodies. The majority of its lyrics are mature, much more mature compared to his age; its mesmerizing to not only teenage girls but also to anyone feeling love.In November 2011, Greyson took a chance to visit the most active social media user based, Asia. He visited Malaysia, Singapore, Philippine and Jakarta, Indonesia.More facts about Greyson, is that apparently he has become the talk of the town, he is very friendly to his fans, creates communication whilst on stage, shakes their hands, and always smiles, he is a media sweetheart.

During 2010-2011 he received at least 5 award nominations, this is a remarkable number for a new comer.Neelam Vaswani the Marygops Marketing director stated I was shocked to see that a 14 year old boy could sing with such a deep voice. I cannot imagine how his fans reacted when he came for the showcase. We are very happy to be able to bring him back for a full concert.When one listens to Greysons songs, it is impossible to portray him as a teenager, most of the lyrics show maturity of the human soul, his voice is solid, it is likely to be impossible for a boy his age to have experienced the stories behind all his lyrics, but that is what makes him unique; his ability to put his empathy into the words, he sings with passion and he will emerge as a star with most potential.We at Marygops are happy that we could bring such a talented young person, Greyson, for us to hold his concert here. The showcase was a very successful one and I am sure the concert will be the same. He not only mesmerized all the young girls, but his talent really does appeal to ones that love music. The concert will be filledwith surprises and I am positive it will be one of the best concerts you will see  Peter Harjani (Project and Creative Director/Finance Director)And once again, no one will be able to stop the Greysonators when it comes to seeing their idol live.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"Don't worry, everyone's favorite ""RINO"" Ron Paul is still doing just dandybut according to MSNBC, a group of anti-poaching conservationists in South Africa accidentally killed the real rhinoceros they were using to demonstrate how to protects rhinos from poachers. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"The 20-year-old rhino, named Spencer, was shot with a tranquilizer gun in front of a crowd of reporters by members of the Rhino Rescue Project, who were documenting a process used to identify protected animals, and deter poachers from killing them for their horns. After he was tranquilized, Spencer's horn was to be treated with a dye and an insecticide, and a tracking device was going to be inserted as well. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"Unfortunately, Spencer never woke up: ""The rhino had an unfortunate reaction to the anesthesia,"" said Rhino Rescue Project spokeswoman Lorinda Hern. ""Every time you dart a rhino, you take a risk that the rhino might not wake up and unfortunately today was one of those days."" Maybe they could have just used life-like sculptures?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"A record 448 rhinos were killed by poachers last year in South Africa, home to the greatest number of the animals. Hern says she blames Spencer's death on those poachers: ""It's sad for us; it's the loss of another animal. It's a death that I still chalk up to poaching."" Next time, maybe they should take a page from zoo keepers and police at the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo, and do all their homework on rhinos before messing with them: "

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"Shouldn't they be punished proportionately to poachers? Poachers kill. These people killed... a death is a death, and a college degree in science shouldn't make you immune to justice."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,Go talk to a vet and ask him about the risks of sedation for any animal. Then ask them if vets deserve to be prosecuted whenever a pet dies because of anesthesia. Seriously.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,No thanks. I'm good.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"Is anyone else thinking what I'm thinking? ""Weekend at Spencer's""! You put the sunglasses on him and I'll move his legs around. It's genius!"

They accidentally took the life of an innocent Rhino as part of an animal rights demonstration, and then blamed poachers for the accident? Maybe they need to rethink their strategy for getting their point across, especially since it involves potentially lethal actions."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,If you've got a better idea let's hear it.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"If the dosage was too high, use the correct dosage.If it was indeed an allergic reaction, they're off the hook...one life to save a thousand is pretty good odds."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"You're getting as bad as felix. Granted, Gothamist screwed up the story by writing it up in the snarkiest, most sensationalistic way possible, but clearly the conservationists were following their standard routine. Ian MacAllen got it right in his comment above. They wouldn't need a tracking device on every rhino if there weren't poachers."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"""You're getting as bad as felix.""Hey man, that was below the belt.Now, I admit I'm not versed on the methods used to sedate and track rhinos, but I do know that it is not unusual for animals to get tranquilized with the wrong dosage, thereby killing the animal. The spokesperson said that the Rhino had an ""unfortunate reaction to the anesthesia,"" but how does she know this was the cause of death? Did she conduct an autopsy? Or is this just her assumption? I suppose it's certainly possible that she's right, but I didn't read anywhere in the article about how she confirmed this. Innocent until proven guilty...fine...but let's see some tests before they're completely off the hook."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"I'm sure they knew what they were doing. If you read the original MSNBC story rather than the garbage Yakas wrote, they have veterinarians take care of the tranquilizers. Do you really think any conservation group would be dumb enough to say, ""Let's try something we're unfamiliar with, and invite the press to watch it all""? Any vet even stateside will tell you knocking out an animal is always a risk. That's why good vets will avoid general anesthesia if at all possible. My vet once went into an X-ray room to calm and hold my cat while the X-ray was taken because she didn't want to risk using a sedative."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,So is the horn up for grabs now?
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,the guy on the far left holding the rhino's ass looks WAY too happy!

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00056,gothamist.com,"Kind of sounds like they were doing what they ordinarily do, which is track Rhinos and make the horns less desirable but were doing it in front of the press to explain the process."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00057,gothamist.com,The single mother who was arrested last week and charged with harassing and stalking Yankees general manager Brian Cashman amidst her claims that she had been Cashman's mistress since last April has levied new charges against Cashman. Louise Neathway (who also goes by the last name Meanwell) claimed to the Daily News that Cashman confided in her that he purposefully misled federal investigators about whether Yankees brass knew certain players used steroids. 
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00057,gothamist.com,"Cashmans spokesman Chris Giglio vehemently denied the accusations: These claims are complete and utter fiction, the latest installment of a carefully concocted campaign of harassment now spewing from a jail cell by a person who is being held on serious criminal felony charges of harassment and extortion, Giglio said. Neathway has already sent an email  to Ron Gardella, chief investigator for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and FBI agent Brian Jacob, advising them of her claims. In that email, she said she had specific details on dates and times that Cashman was aware of steroid use by players."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00057,gothamist.com,"Neathway has been charged with grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, stalking, and aggravated harassment. Among other things, Cashman's lawyers say the 36-year-old British national was an unhinged con woman out to extort him, bombarding him with text messages and calls during the past 10 months. She allegedly tried to blackmail him into paying for a $15,000 medical treatment, threatening to contact the press and his family if he didnt. Cashman says he eventually caved, and gave her $6,000 in different bank accounts, before contacting police."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00057,gothamist.com,"Manhattan prosecutors have now subpoenaed Cashmans bank recordswhich Post sources say include evidence that he gave her as much as $20,000 to Neathwayin order to determine whether she truly was extorting him for months, or if they were legitimate gifts as part of an affair. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00057,gothamist.com,"Neathway, who has 13 orders of protection against her since 1998, has been characterized by her exes as ""ruthless,"" ""intimidating,"" and ""conniving."" Neathway claimed Cashman had gotten her pregnant, but an ultrasound she emailed him was ultimately proven to be a fake, and Neathway's mother said she ""was never pregnant, and had lied about it in the past as well."" "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00057,gothamist.com,"Former boyfriend David Sano told the Post he went through a very similar situation with her a decade ago: their relationship started after she claimed she was pregnant after a one-night stand, and ended around the time she personally delivered a sex tape featuring Sano and his former schoolteacher girlfriend to the headmaster of the Christian school where the woman worked. Thats what Louise does, Sano said. She takes pleasure in other peoples pain."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00058,gothamist.com,"Hearing Frank Prizinzano describe his calf brains is like listening to a man who just won the lottery. ""Oh, they were just gorgeous. People started seeing other tables eat them, and then they would order them, and before you knew it we sold out before 7:30,"" he said. ""We countered the gaminess with smokiness by searing themthat and capers, some sage with fresh kale on the side,"" Prizinzano makes a sweeping gesture with his hands. ""Incredible."" All this is to say that the man takes his cooking very seriously, which is why his delightfully inexpensive, superbly delicious new restaurant Sauce is one of our favorite places to eat."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00058,gothamist.com,"Everything at Sauce is handmade, and the meat, Prizinzano will remind you, is all locally sourced, humanely slaughtered, and cut from the whole animal in-house by Sauce's butcher Adam Tiberio. The beef is also grass fed. ""It's almost offensive how different it tastes if you're used to normal beef,"" the chef says. ""But then you start craving it, and you won't eat anything else."" A sandwich made with grass fed meatballs in a tomato gravy on a brioche bun with a side of greens tossed in olive oil and salt is $6.95."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00058,gothamist.com,"""We use every part of the animalall of the bones, scraps for stock, everything. We even make soap from the fat,"" Prizinzano says, explaining how he keeps costs down. ""Also, the portions are smaller. We want people to try everything."" Will costs start going up once it's impossible to get a table? ""Maybe by a dollar or so,"" he concedes. Prinzano's partner, Rob DeFlorio, one of the men behind Mother, says ""If we're doing our job you won't even notice."" "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00058,gothamist.com,"This is good news, because at Sauce you can cover a lot of ground for a little scratch. When we're ravenous at lunch, a porchetta sandwich on a Caputo baguette and a plate of ricotta cavatelli does the trick. For dinner, the chef pitched us a special: Mezzanelli Amatriciana Tracchiolle. A special pork sparerib belly chop is cured for a few days, slow cooked for 18 hours, then charred in a pan. ""Mezzanelli is basically like giant buccatiniand that's in a thick tomato gravy. Scissored mint goes on top, along with some percorino toscano. It comes on a big-ass plate,"" Prizinzano brings it over. Indeed it is huge, more than enough for two people. ""That's $24.95."""
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00058,gothamist.com,"Sauce doesn't yet have a website, or a full bar (they're hoping to get the license by the end of this month), and outdoor seating will be unveiled in time for spring. But the chef and owner behind an Italian empire in the East Village is forming a locally-sourced meat co-op in Albany, scoping out a LIC warehouse to store his whole animals, and dreams of Sauce, becoming a ""commissary"" for other kitchenless locations in New York. His glass-paned butcher's room is also a demo kitchen. ""The idea is that everything on our menu will have a link to a video, showing you how we make it,"" he says."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00058,gothamist.com,"""We want people to make this food part of their staple diet, that's why everything is fresh and it's not too expensive,"" he says. ""I grew up eating this food, my children grew up eating this food, and I'm healthy."" We're not sure what the Surgeon General would think of eating Sauce's beef shank tortelloni three times a week (""it knocked me out of my fucking chair,"" Prizinzano says). But when you're it washing down with a glass of primitivo, who cares? "

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00059,gothamist.com,"There have been plenty of seals spotted around the city in recent yearsat Gracie Mansion, in Inwood, on Brighton Beach, even on the Upper West Side. If you haven't had the luck of spotting one in person, however, the American Princess cruise boat is here to help you make your own luck, whisking you away to seal hot spots."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00059,gothamist.com,"Seal watching season has officially beguntours started on February 4th and will run through April 15th. Tour guide Paul Sieswerdatold explained to the the NY Post, There is a growing population of harbor seals in the East Coast,"" and one group even counted 43 seals in a single two-hour trip. Some have even had bonus sightings of falcons, egrets, herons, whales and dolphins (but typically you'll see those after seal season). Some people have been posting the sightings on the boat's Facebook page. Sieswerdatold is the former curator for the New York and New England aquariums, and at the latter even cared for Andre, who the 1994 childrens film Andre was based off. He even raised an abandoned baby seal at his home on Staten Island until finding a permanent aquarium home for it."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00059,gothamist.com,"The tours run Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 2:30 p.m. and cost $27 for adults, $15 for kids. You meet at Riis Landing in Rockaway, and once aboard will go through the lower New York Bay, south of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Bonus: there's a coffee bar and a real bar on the boat, for when you're making the slow journey out to seal territory."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"Video: Greg Kelly Returns To Good Day New York, Thanks Social Media Supporters  After successfully fending off a heavy rape allegation, life is back to normal for Good Day New York co-host Greg Kelly, son of NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly. The 43-year-old former Marine told reporters he felt ""terrific"" as he returned to the Fox New York office on East 67th Street this morning, and he was welcomed back warmly by his co-host Rosanna Scotto. ""So, you're back,"" Scotto observed, turning to Kelly, who made a short statement at the start of the broadcast that left out any specifics about his absence. Here's video:"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"""Rosanna its great to see you,"" Kelly said on-air. ""Folks, thank you. It was a tough couple of weeks obviously for a lot of people. And Im very, very grateful for all the support I had here at Fox Five, the support from my family and friends, those I care about and the viewers of course. Theyve been just great, the people who watch the show, and have weighed in through social media, positive remarks. Thank you very much."""
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"The speech concluded with a smattering of applause from the newsroom. ""And I'm especially grateful to this woman sitting next to me, Rosanna Scotto,"" Kelly added. Scotto then told Kelly they were ""going right back to where we left off,"" to which Kelly replied, ""I don't know about that. I don't want to work too hard. Today's Friday."" And speaking of social media, Twitter user @NewKingofMedia wrote, ""Greg Kelly proves if an awful woman is lyin & ur the semi famous white son of the Police Commissioner, it will all be resolved very quickly."" "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"Kelly also issued a statement last night saying, ""I am thankful that the investigation established what Ive known all along, that I am innocent of the allegations that were waged against me. I am so blessed to have a wonderful family and friends whose support for me never wavered."" "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"Ray Kelly has not commented publicly on the allegation, but Mayor Bloomberg told reporters earlier this week that DA Cy Vance ""did exactly what he should do. He right away called his best sex crime investigators, put it on the case. They concluded, apparently, according to the paper [where Bloomberg read the news], that there was no law broken, no reason to bring charges on either side and dismissed the thing. Now lets get back to focusing on things that take this city and this country forward."""

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"There is no proof that it she was pregnant and if she was there is no proof that it was Kelly who impregnated her. She showed poor judgement from the start and showed that she is irresponsible and reckless. First, to cheat on her boyfriend, then to have unprotected sex and finally to have sex in her boss's office. All the actions of someone who doesn't respect any boundaries of normal behavior. If she was capable of all of this, then what else is she capable of?I never thought much of Greg Kelly before this, actually thought he was a bit of a buffoon. But, he handled this situation with a lot of grace and character and I respect that. I have to say, that I actually like him now and will likely pay more attention to his career.Hopefully Kelly learned something going through this and is more careful moving forward letting people get to him like this. It's a shame the DA didn't press charges against her, her actions were beyond criminal.The bottom line is that no man should have to have his named dragged through the mud because of some lying, cheating, reckless, irresponsible girl."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"Dude, the guy clearly didn't do it. What are you talking about?Read the facts of the case. She was drunk and cheated and tried to double back on it."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"Wrong. She couldn't remember the sex act. The police found her story to remain consistent and they did not think she was lying. It is not clear at all that he didn't do it. The only thing clear is that there wasn't enough evidence. One of three things happened:(1) She was blackout drunk - NOT unconcious, but in a state where she is not herslef at all and will not remember anything that happened the next day. Several of my friends are like this and it's scary - they seem concious, they're not slurring their words or stumbling but they are beyond drunk and the next day they have zero recollection of conversations and events that took place.If they had sex in this state, it's probably not rape since she consented, but you have to be pretyy drunk yourself, or a real weirdo/creep to go through it if you're the guy. Of course, they did JUST MEET, so maybe he didn't even notice.(2) She passed out and he had sex with her. Obviously, this is rape, but if she didn't remember what happened -- i.e., she didn't even remember passing out, and he didn't admit it, you can't bring charges.(3) She consented, she remembered it, she got busted for cheating and tried to deflect it by bringing charges. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"""She was blackout drunk - NOT unconcious""Wrong! The bar tab was so low, it was determined she only had a few drinks. Also, surveillance showed her walking, not staggering drunk, through her office building. Finally, what about the steamy sex messages back and forth between them both.All it proves to me is she's a good liar."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"This is, out of every argument that's been used in this case, by far the most ridiculous. You have no idea how high this woman's tolerance for alcohol is (I've seen women get totally smashed off two beers). You have no idea if she had a few drinks before she got to the bar. You have no idea if other patrons at the bar bought Greg Kelly and his date some drinks. A bar tab is seriously the most insubstantial piece of evidence, and you are an idiot for thinking a low bar tab proves anything.Also, for the last fucking time: these ""steamy sex messages"" are only evidenced by a tabloid's anonymous sources. That's it, that's all. Yes, we know they exchanged texts, but the Post's anonymous sources are the only ones releasing the content. You might as well tell me you take everything the National Enquirer says at face value, too."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"First of all, she could have been drunk when she showed up at the bar orthe bartender (or another patron) could have bought them shots. Second -- and here is where my public service annoiuncment comes in - I've seen people get blackout drunk after two drinks. It's really, really weird. Theycan walk straight and they're not slurring, but you can tell something is completelyoff. Sometimes they act or speak really irrationally. You think you're having a conversation with a sober person but they don;t make any sense. It's pretty scary, actually. I've seen the same thing with people who do get obviously drunk, slurring, stumbling, etc. where the next day they have no idea what happened for the last few hours of the night. But the kind where they seem sober but are really totally wasted is weird. Also, we haven't seen the texts so we really don't know what they say. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"The DA did not conclude that no law was broken, nor that Greg Kelly was innocent. Just that there was not enough evidence to prosecute. Nice spin for your guy Bloomberg."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"The DA had not enough, if any, evidence to bring charges, which is the lowest bar to surpass, and step one in ""prosecuting"" someone. Getting a grand jury indictment is the next higher bar, then proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is even higher. Kelly is presumed innocent from the outset. Even if he were brought to trial and found not-guilty, you'd have to give him the presumption of innocence. Not to mention that in this case, not only was he not brought to trial, nor a grand jury indictment not handed down nor sought, but the DA didn't even bring any charges. Linda Fairstein, a former sex crimes prosecutor and expert said independently that she had not seen or heard anyone establish the elements of a sex crime having been committed.Does that information help you to reassess your position?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"Not the way this case was handled. Especially with the former prosecuter Farstein chiming in when the investigation was ongoing. Completely innappropriate. Fix was in from the start. The DA has no credibility. Too many leaks and opinions on page 6 before the outcome was finalized.Greg Kelly may think he is in the clear. But there are too many people who see this as business as usual. The combination of the  son of the NYPD Commissioner, a white man with an apparent sense of entitlement and a sham investigation is not something to be proud of."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,Nice spin yourself. He's innocent. Throw her ass in jail. More women should be pissed at this lying accuser for making it harder for true rape victims to come forward.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"it will be harder for woman to come forward because of people like you and the New YORK POST who vilified her even before the investigation with those ""new leaks"". SHAME ON Cy Vance. what a tool, a political tool as well. Same as the NYPD release the kid's police record after they shot him. Same play book."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"You can't leak what ain't there.It's a shame that you can't see through the superficial veneer of the ""leaks"", if any, to the inconvenient fact that there was information not favorable to the allegations to leak in the first place."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00060,gothamist.com,"NO one is free of ""sin"". Treat all people equally. a bad kid doesn't deserve to be executed by NYPD nor does a foolish woman deserve to be raped by a news anchor. This attack on victims is wrong.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00061,gothamist.com,"Indian Point Flack Stoked About New Nukes In Georgia  On Thursday the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a license request for a new nuclear power plant to be built near Augusta, Georgia. It's the first new nuclear power plant to get a green light from the government since the Three Mile Island meltdown in 1979. Go Isotopes! Now nuclear power enthusiasts are spinning this faster than an overheating centrifuge, heralding the licensing as the dawn of a new era in nuclear energy. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00061,gothamist.com,"Jim Steets, a spokesman for the controversial Indian Point facility just north of New York City tells CBS 880, ""Its positive news for the industry and I think the benefits of nuclear power are clear."" It certainly makes his job easier for a day or two, since the last time Indian Point was in the news, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was rejecting some of the power plants fire safety procedures. Governor Cuomo has said that Indian Point should close, and the facility has been under increased scrutiny ever since an earthquake in Japan damaged the Fukishima nuclear reactor. Indian Point sits at the intersection of two fault lines and has been branded the most vulnerable to an earthquake in the nation."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00061,gothamist.com,"As for the Georgia plant, it goes without saying that not everyone is as sanguine as Indian Point's spokesman. Laura Haight at the New York Public Interest Research Group maintains that ""private financing is almost dead in the water for nuclear power plants. Its too risky. Its too expensive."" And Allison Fisher, an energy expert for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, called the Georgia plant a step in the wrong direction. ""It is inexplicable that weve chosen this moment in history to expand the use of a failed and dangerous technology,"" Fisher told the Washington Post. Oh, would you relax, hippie?

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00062,gothamist.com,"The annual fight over school closures between the city, parents, teachersand now, Occupiersreturned in full force last night for a raucous, crazy meeting at Brooklyn Tech. More than 2,000 people showed up for an evening the Times describes as being like ""several meetings were going on at once, all of them confused and cacophonous, with sound spilling over from one group to the next."" In the end, the Panel for Education Policy voted to close or partially close the 23 schools they announced in December. And even without Cathie Black to kick around like last year, the meeting wasn't the most orderly."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00062,gothamist.com,"""There are important proposals up for discussion,"" current Schools Commissioner Walcott said. ""If all the [teachers union] wants to do is bus in Occupy Wall Street protesters...then we will just have to work around that."" And so they did. Because, in addition to the Teachers Union which had originally planned to hold a meeting in a nearby school, a group calling themselves Occupy the Department of Education were also on hand to help foster ""an atmosphere that was more chaotic than usual."" There was a heavy police presence, but the NYPD press office tells us there weren't any arrests."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00062,gothamist.com,"In the end PEP, which consists of Walcott and 13 members appointed by the mayor and borough presidents voted to close all the schools on the block (as it has done every time it has convened). And this was only the beginning. The City is aiming to close 62 schools this year as part of Mayor Bloomberg's educational reform plans. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00062,gothamist.com,"Amid the chanting, parents, teachers and students spoke to the Panel in the hopes of saving their schools. ""Im angry and Im frustrated. I am afraid for the future of my childs life,"" one mother at the hearing said.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"TIGA (The Independent Game Developers Association) has been fighting with the UK government over tax breaks for the gaming industry. According to the New York Times, Because video game makers straddle the lines between software development, the entertainment industry and online retailing, they can combine tax breaks in ways that companies like Netflix and Adobe cannot. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"But this isnt the case in the UK, meaning that many UK developers are emigrating, heading to countries which provide those types of incentives. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,Rocksteady designer Sefton Hill has described this as a talent-drain for the UK gaming industry. 
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"In an interview with CVG, Hill was asked whether or not he thought the UK could be competitive with countries like the US with regard to gaming.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"I concede that some video games, or even entire video game genres, are simply too complex or difficult for certain players to appreciate. Or, perhaps, some individuals simply dislike lengthy, complicated experiences. In some regards, I have to admit that games can be major investment, and if someone is unwilling to dip past the surface mechanics of a video game, then they are entitled to their reservations. In that sense, I can rationalize the existence of a game like King Arthur II, despite my dislike for games of its philosophy. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"King Arthur II is, obviously, the sequel to King Arthur: The Roleplaying Wargame, a game unique in that it ties together multiple genres into a fairly well executed package. King Arthur II adopts much of its predecessors gameplay, but also expands upon it slightly. Still, this is clearly not as profound a package as a Total War game, and it shows through the games presentation and gameplay."

In our newest feature, Typing About Games (TAG), two of the Piki Geek staff face off in a no-holds-bar chat conversation. Beliefs are challenged, points are exclaimed, hype is harnessed, and video games are dissected like insects. Enjoy a look into the discussions that plague the Piki Geek chat day after day."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"In any argument about whether or not games can be art, anything developed by Team Ico (Ico, Shadow of the Colossus) must come up. They are beautiful, emotional games with a simple story and overwhelming depth. Its for these reasons that their newest project, the Last Guardian, has been highly anticipated throughout the six years since the release of Shadow of the Colossus. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"Fans still gush about the game and come up with buckets of fan-art, despite the fact that there havent been any real public updates in three years, and reports that director Fumito Ueda had left Sony. However, 1UP has thrown us a bone to chew on while we wait for the real prize, as they interviewed Sony Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida about the Last Guardian."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"First, Yoshida wanted to stress that Ueda didnt leave Sony. He isnt an employee, but he is continuing to work on the Last Guardian as a contractor, without any real changes to his presence on the team. He still goes into the office every day, working the longest hours."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"As far as rumors go, the suggestion that the new Xbox console will have a built-in touchscreen like the Wii U is one of the least substantiated, but were hearing it again. Last month, GameSpot was discussing the likelihood of the controller prototype and now Xbox World magazine is reporting from their sources that this decision is more than just conjecture. "
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"The report in XBW suggests that the controller design is hoping to look more akin to a handheld, like the PS Vita, rather than a sizable tablet controller, like the Wii U.

Its basically a physics-driven puzzler, where the goal is to fling sentient balls of paint around in an effort to drench and detonate bomb clusters.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00070,geek.pikimal.com,"The latest dev diary, Flipping Out, details the games flip mechanic; a sort of time reversal maneuver that allows your Splatter to fly back in the direction from whence it came.

In this case, that thing is the trademark of the acronym DOTA. Blizzard recently filed a complaint against Valve in an attempt to gain control of DOTA and all related names."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,"DOTA, or Defense of the Anicents, began as a mod in Blizzards popular RTS, Warcraft 3. Valve became interested in making DOTA 2 after corresponding with Icefrog, DOTAs original developer, and inviting him to the Valve offices. Soon after, they filed a trademark for DOTA so that they could begin work on the sequel. Meanwhile, Blizzard is in the midst of creating a Blizzard DOTA for Starcraft 2."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,"DOTA has been used as the popular name of a Warcraft III software mod file that has been distributed, marketed, and promoted by Blizzard and its fans (under license from Blizzard); that utilizes and is built upon the Warcraft III game engine, interface, and gameplay mechanics; that is comprised of Warcraft III characters, items, spells, artwork, textures, and color palates; that can be played only using Warcraft III software and via Blizzards online service Battle.net; and whose name (DOTA, an acronym for Defense of the Ancients) is a reference to Warcraft III characters known as the Ancients."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,"Warcraft IIIs EULA clearly specifies that all underlying intellectual property rights in and to Warcraft III are owned by Blizzard: All title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in and to the Program and any and all copies thereof (including, but not limited to, any titles, computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialog, catch phrases, locations, concepts, artwork, animations, sounds, musical compositions, audiovisual effects, methods of operation, moral rights, any related documentation, and `applets incorporated into the Program) are owned by Blizzard or its licensors."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,What does everything think about this? Do you think Blizzard has valid claims for the ownership of the title? Or should it go to Valve and Icefrog? Speak up in the comments!
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00074,geek.pikimal.com,"Im pretty sure Valve laid claim to the Dota 2 name by using it as an acronym stripped of the acronymity, thus making it a legitimate name that doesnt mean anything."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"While color creates the mood and feel of the site bydirecting user attention to certain elements, there are many ways to approach the use of color. Hue, value, and saturation are all three integrated dimensions of color that, when used properly, can enhance the sites message just as well,if not better, than using flashy colors."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"In this article well delve deeper into color psychology as it relates to web design, and view examples of sites that used color persuasively in their branding efforts."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"For a primer on color, one should refer to the color wheel, as it presents a logically arranged sequence of pure hues. Im sure youre familiar with the primaries  red, yellow, and blue; and secondaries:green, orange, and purple  which are formed by mixing the primaries."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"Tertiary colors are comprised of the middle colors like yellow-green and blue-green. They are created by mixing a primary color and a secondary color. We often refer to the color wheel as it can be used to create harmonious color schemes, leading to an effective visual experience."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"The two most popular advertising color choices in America,blue and red,are frequently used on websites globally. Blue connotes trustworthiness, loyalty, and sincerity, and is most often a business favorite due to these attributes."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,But blue isnt for everyone and the best method of determining the right color (or colors) for your brand or website is to first consider the target group youre trying to reach.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"Colors have different meanings to various age groups, cultures, and nationalities. Theyhave the power to reach beyond just connotations and hold the viewers attention, communicate what the business is about, and make a sale."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,When you think of the impact color has on a particular audience its easy to see why companies exert a lot of time and effort in choosing the right one.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,A common solution for drawing attention to monochromatic links is to give them a faint background to lift them off the page. This technique is shown in the navigation for AppZapper.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"The active link on the navigation for Font Explorer is styled differently than the rest, giving the user a quick glimpse at where they are on the website."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,Postbox uses red and blue onits call- to-action buttons. These highly saturated and large buttons do a great jobof drawing attention to the intended action the user should take  todownload or buy the software.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"A Small Orange makes use ofits brand colors inthe list of recent news posts. The color doesnt overwhelm, as its used sparingly with a white background to ease its vibrancy."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"If the text on your site is meant for scanning instead of reading, its okay to have gray text on a black background. On the website for VersionsApp, the monotony is broken up through highlighting and the use of splashes of color throughout the text."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"Sometimes the best solution is to have dark text on a white background. Readability is hardly a problem with this method. When necessary, you can incorporate color into quotes or bullet points as shown herefor Crazy Egg."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,The great thing about designing for this niche is good design judgment is really all it takes. For instance dont use colors with similar brightness values as the base of your website. This causes the text to vibrate and can lead to watery eyes.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"Also, if youre going to use a change in background color to designate a hover state, make sure it has enough contrast and is different in its relative brightness."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"Were past the era of web design where we have to use as many flashy colors as possible to grab the users attention. Thankfully, weve developed insight into how we can convey a message using shades of one color."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,The use of monochromatic color in layouts is a common practice for designers who want to portray a balanced interface while focusing on the overall UX instead of merely coloring things up.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,"The Invoice Machine uses a grayscale for the design ofits invoicing softwares website.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,Gray is a common color used in web design these days because it doesnt compete with saturated and desaturated colors.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00080,blog.crazyegg.com,The absence of color on The Grid System site is a great opportunity to make use of white space and bold typography when necessary. Such elements help create hierarchy by grouping elements together according to importance.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,"Sure, Jane could place the above testimonials on the home page. Or, in a rotating area in the sidebar, header or footer."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,Great marketers and sales people seem to know just the right time to say something. They can anticipate the next question in the mind of the prospect.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,The difficulty in writing good sales copy is anticipating the prospects next question without being with them physically.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,"Put some thought into the placement of your testimonials. If you do, youlllikely find a strategic area to place each testimonial."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,"For instance, on the sales page for Janes website design services there will be (or should be) an area where Jane addresses the issue of price. Some testing would be in order, but for those without the time or the volume of traffic needed to test, it would make sense to place this testimonial next to your discussion about pricing."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,"In general, dont just place testimonials without thinking. Take a minute to place the testimonial in alocation where it has the best chance of overcoming the objection that is on the prospects mind."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,"Unfortunately, we have grown skeptical of testimonials."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00081,blog.crazyegg.com,"Too many scammers out there writing testimonials that range from clearly fake to slightly cheesy. As a result, testimonials have to have meat on their bones."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"Buy, donate or subscribe. It doesnt matter. They want to do it."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,But not everyone can write sales letters like that. Unless you know the three appeals that are behind every successful advertisement.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,The good sales letters use at least one of these appeals. The best use all three.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,What are these three appeals? Lets explore.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Soft core. Hard core. No core.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Sex sells.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Mens Health knows this and makes a mint from creating products and sales letter that put the physical actand how to get better at/more of itas a key motivator for sales. The image above is from one of their productsThe Big Book of Sex.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"But using sex as an appeal isnt limited to the physical act. Sex includes love, friendship and affection. This is what I mean by no core."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Love Panky is appealing to women who not only want to fall in true love with a manbut make that same man fall in love with them.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,What makes these appeals work so well is that they are native to what is being sold. Bad uses of this appeal occur when you try to pump up sales with woman who strip while you talk about your web domain service.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"Go Daddy, anyone?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Its in our bones. That desire to live like the rich.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Jet set around the world. Own boats as big as school buses. Spill more sashimi than most people will eat in a lifetime.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,The Rich Jerk successfully milked this appeal for years. And its what fuels the Motley Fool:
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Greed is why magazines like Money and Fortune are popular. While these magazines are straight-forward about their goal [getting rich] its less obvious in publications like Financial Times or Forbes.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,But its still there.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"If you can show someone how to make six figures a year, retire young or evenhorde hundreds of products through couponsthen you are using the greed appeal correctly."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"Just like sex sells, so does fear. It could be a test crash dummy hitting a dash board at 60 miles per hour. A group of teenagers piling up body bags outside of the headquarters of a cigarette manufacturer. Or a life of poverty for your children after you die."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Fear appeals work on that sense of uncertainty we have. This is why insurance and services like tax shelters that protect your money from the hands of the government and greedy lawyers are so effective.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"At first blush it might not seem to be about fear, but notice the phrase change your life. Theres the uncertainty I was talking about. Its combined with the bad news of the U.S. debt downgrade to make an intriguing headline that could prove crucial if you decide to ignore."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"Using just one of these appeals in your sales letter will get you some good response. Use two, and youll get even better. All threethats a sales letter orgasm."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"Youve got the sex, greed [""Billion Dollar""] and the fear [""Problem""]. This wouldnt make a great sales letter headline, however. You know why? Its not clear that the problem impacts the reader or that hell personally benefit if he reads the copy."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,If you want to do that youd write Why the Loud Sex Problem Is Costing You a Billion Dollars.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,Greed is behind the Publishing Clearing Houses Sweepstakes and state lottery games. Illinois took it a step further and hilariously wove fear into their greed appeal.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"Let me close with a little secret: out of all of the above appeals greed is the most powerful. Meaning, if you can appeal to peoples greed you are going to write a better sales letter. This is born out by my own experienceand its born out by copywritingveteranslike John Caples."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00082,blog.crazyegg.com,"Then again, if you can write a sales letter appeal combining all threeyou just might be able to retire young in a radioactive-safe bunker with Angelina Jolie. Or Brad Pitt."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"For a lot of bloggers, self hosting with Wordpress.org provides the most professional blogging platform available. If you started out using Blogger and now need a professional presence, theres a good chance that youre ready to switch to Wordpress.org."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"But the point of this article isnt to convince you to switch. If youre trying to decide whether or not to switch, there are better articles to read. But if you have decided to switch, this post will walk you through step by step how to quickly and easily transfer from Blogger to Wordpress.org."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"The first step in transferring from Blogger to Wordpress.org is to sign up for hosting. If you havent picked out a hosting company yet, Blue Host offers low prices that are competitive with other popular Wordpress hosts, and theyre also reliable. To top it off, they provide excellent customer service, and theyre control panel is one of the easiest to use. You cant go wrong by choosing Blue Host."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Another good choice is Host Gator. They offer some of the best rates in the business, and theyre known for their excellent customer service."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Note: If you havent already purchased a domain name, Blue Host also offers a free domain name when you set up your account."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"After signing up for hosting, the next step is to install Wordpress on your hosting account. To do so, first log into your hosting control panel. Next, find the Wordpress icon located underneath a heading such as Simplescripts Installation or Software/Services. The wording will be different for each hosting company, and you can always start a live chat with customer support if you need help. Once you find the icon, follow the steps to install Wordpress."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Note: If possible, youll want to install Wordpress as a temporary installment. This will allow you to set up the site on a temporary site so you arent making all of the changes live while your readers are watching."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"The next step is to import posts from Blogger to Wordpress. To do so, log into your temporary wordpress installment by going to http://yourtemporarydomain.com/wp-admin. After logging in, go to the left-hand sidebar and click on Tools and then select Import Posts. On the next page where youll be asked which type of posts youd like to import, choose the option titled Blogger."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Youll next be asked if youd like to install an importer for Blogger. The answer is yes, so click the red button to install the importer. Then click to activate and install the plugin. Youll now click to authorize Wordpress to access your Blogger account, and then follow the steps to import posts from Blogger to Wordpress."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Now that the posts have been transferred, youll need to double check that all of the posts and comments transferred correctly. You can do this by comparing the number of posts and comments in Wordpress to the number of posts and comments in Blogger. Youll have at least one extra post and one extra page in Wordpress due to the fact that Wordpress automatically generates a welcome post and sample page when its first installed. Youll want to delete each of these posts and pages."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Note: Sometimes not all of the posts or comments transfer correctly. If this is the case, there may or may or may not be an easy way to get all of the posts transferred. You can contact Blogger or troubleshoot by searching on Google if these posts are critical for your blog. In cases like this, its often easier to not worry about the lost posts and move on."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"After making sure the content transferred correctly and is ready to go, navigate to Appearance in the right-hand sidebar of the Wordpress dashboard and select themes.Then click Install Themes at the top of the page and follow the steps to install a new Wordpress theme."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Youll want to pick out a theme that you like and configure it to work the way you want it to. After picking the right theme for your site, you can take some time to configure it to look the way you want it to by installing plugins and widgets and adding pages. You can even pay a designer for a custom theme if youre so inclined."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"The next step is to change the permalink structure in Wordpress. The reason you have to do this is that Blogger does crazy things with their permalink structure. In order to minimize the number of broken links, youll need to change the permalink structure in Wordpress to match the crazy setup in Blogger."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"To do this, click on Settings in the left-hand sidebar of the Wordpress dashboard, and then click permalinks. Now, click the radio button for custom structure. To the right of the button, copy and paste this: /%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%.html"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,The permalink structure in Wordpress will now match the structure on the old Blogger site. This will cause most of the links to work properly and minimize the number of broken links.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Note: This will minimize the number of broken links, but it wont eliminate them entirely. This is due to the fact that Blogger removes articles such as a, an, and the from urls for post titles and Wordpress does not. Because of this, a post with a title such as, The Absolute Best Way to Start a Wordpress Blog, will have a url that looks like www.yourdomain.com/absolute-best-way-start-wordpress-blog in Blogger and www.yourdomain.com/the-absolute-best-way-to-start-a-wordpress-blog in Wordpress. One way to fix this is to go through and manually change the broken urls in Wordpress. The other way is to not worry about it. If theres a third and better way and you know what that is, make sure to leave a comment at the end of this post."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Now that youre using Wordpress, youll need to sign up for Feedburner in order to manage RSS feeds and subscriptions yourself. Start by going to Feedburner and signing up for an account. Youl then walk through the steps to set up your Feedburner account and burn a feed. If you need more instructions about how to do that, you can find that outhere and here."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Now that the new Wordpress site is set up and ready to go, youre ready to change the domain settings of your temporary site (this assumes that you set up the site on a temporary domain). To do this, log into your hosting panel and find an icon labeled phpMyAdmin and click. Next, click on databases and then click the database for your Wordpress installation. Now, find wp_options and click. Line 1 will be for your site url. Click to edit this line and change it out the url from the temporary one to the permanent one. Now, click wp_options again, click to edit line 37, and again replace the temporary url with the new one."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"Note: If this step becomes too difficult, contact customer for your hosting account. Theres a good chance that they can walk you through it by chat or even make the change for you."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00083,blog.crazyegg.com,"The next and final step is to forward the nameservers for your domain name. To do this, youll log into the dashboard where you purchased your domain. Youll then click to manage the domain and then click to edit the nameservers. Youll do this by replacing them with the nameserver information where your site is hosted. The new nameservers will look something like this: ns1.bluehost.com and ns2.bluehost.com."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The name Amazon.com has become synonymous with eCommerce.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"If you are reading this blog, there is no doubt that you have ordered something from Amazon.com from the comforts of your desktop or laptop computer."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Today, it is only slightly less likely that you have ordered something from Amazon from your phone."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Im no exception. Yesterday, I ordered a pair of ear buds on my iPhone from Amazon in between the time my dental hygienist cleaned my teeth and the dentist came in to give me the verdict."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"We asked our Crazy Egg Design and Marketing Experts to analyze the Amazon mobile website design. Take a hard look yourself, read through our opinions and, if you are so inclined, give us your analysis in the comments below."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,1. Using a simple one column structure as a list view for the interface. Adding multi column structures for any small mobile device makes the entire real estate feel crammed and harder to use.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"2. Keeping things simple by introducing high level functions and options that are most important such as: search, cart, wish list, streamlined menus."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"3. Information for the product is minimal to start, but if user is interested, they can go to the next layout with more details. Biggest mistake most people make is providing too much copy/content on one screen, especially for mobile."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,4. Option to use full site at the bottom. Providing the user the option to choose experience is important.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"5. Graphics, colors, and overall aesthetics are clean and minimal  which help performance and keep maintenance costs lower."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The user experience for the Amazon Mobile site should be very simple; make it as easy as possible for someone to find a product and complete a purchase. This successfully achieves that, and by focusing on the most popular product categories (Books, Kindle, Movies and Electronics) it can keep the navigation as intuitive as possible."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,Im also really happy to see that they offer a clear link to the Amazon.com full site. Its amazing how many mobile sites dont do this.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The Amazon mobile home page is a great example of a mobile optimized website. Its easy to navigate and gives the user what they are looking for right away  the amazon search bar.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The ad below the search bar for Amazon Apps doesnt appear to be an ad at all and is, very likely, the reason the user navigated to Amazon on their mobile device in the first place."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The mobile site seems easy to navigate since appears very similar to the regular website. The cart is at the top, always reminding you how many items you have so far and the search bar and department categories are easy to navigate as well."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Amazon are usability experts. Their website isnt the prettiest thing out there, nor is their mobile site, but they do an amazing job of getting users to the products they want! I buy just about everything I own from Amazon and I do that not only because of pricing but because it can be easier to find it on Amazon than my local retail outlet. Retailers, are you listening?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Given how much attention Amazon pays to what users are doing on their site, they most likely took their top categories and made them easily accessible. The arrows on the buttons are great functional suggestions. I can tell that if I push Books the page is going to slide down in an accordion effect and I can tell that if I push See All Departments Im going to head off to another screen. This is very effective in letting the user know whats going to happen. To the savvy user it lets you know what you can do with a spotty 3G/4G connection and what you may want to wait for a more stable connection to do."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I love how the account specific and sub-categories are styled differently. This style change lets me know that these choices are specific to me and/or my account.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Finally, the best part of all, FULL SITE! I cant tell you how many poor mobile sites Ive been to where the experience was so lacking I wanted to go to the full site. You know what those poor mobile sites all have in common? They dont let you go to the full site! A+ to Amazon for giving me the freedom to choose."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The site looks very clean and easy to use. The theme matches the www.amazon.com theme and helps promote the websites branding.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The two containers (blue and yellow) have different styles. The blue one has rounded corners and is smaller in width than the yellow one  which has square corners. It might be more consistent if they were both the same style unless they are supposed to be separated.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,From the screenshot it is unclear as to whether the department list is used when a search is done (as is the case on the www.amazon.com). This is mainly due to having advertisement in between the search field and the department list.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The Cart and Wishlist links are duplicated once up the top and once down the bottom. Given that mobile screen space is limited, one set should be removed."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"This is a very useful mobile page. It has most of the features of the main site, in a smaller format with quick links to get to the most popular items. I would guess that Amazon has research or analytics telling them which categories are essential to show on this page, so I trust their judgment."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"I could nitpick some stuff (like wasting so much height on the ad for the Kindle Fire ensuring that anyone on an iPhone will never see the menus without scrolling down first), but I said I wouldnt nitpick so Ill stop."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The great thing about the Amazon Mobile home page design is the fact that it is a simple design that one can identify as Amazon just by the fonts and colors. The use of the viewable space (before you would have to scroll below the fold) is great. The subtle placement of deals below the logo is pretty sly, plus having the button to promote the mobile app below the search bar is a great idea. The end user may find it easier to download the app and have it readily available then have to navigate to Amazon each time through the phones browser."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"The Amazon mobile home page does an impressive job of presenting their large and complex navigation into a scaled down intuitive menu. The order and use of different colors for the primary and secondary menus helps provide visual clarity. I like that theyve featured search and their mobile app at the top of the page, since those are likely top actions for mobile users. The blue primary accent color leaves orange (opposite on the color wheel) as the optimal CTA color which they implemented fairly well."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"On the improvement note, links on the page need an audit check for adequate text size and padding to ensure theyre easily clickable. (Tip: Your pinky nail can work as a handy mobile sizing/spacing guide for links since its mostly likely the size of the your index fingers pressable surface area.)"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,This is a very decent way to show the most popular navigation options. Im sure that Amazon tested this pretty thoroughly before concluding what people would click on most.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,The only thing Id like if I were to use that application is that the advertisement was further down underneath the departments. It seems more intuitive to have them directly underneath the search box instead.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"I think the Amazon homepage has struck an excellent balance between easy navigation to a lot of different places (which is absolutely necessary, given the complexity of the site), and showcasing the product that they are currently trying to push (currently the Kindle Fire). The guideline that Id take away from this design is that first you want to put front and center in front of your audience whatever you want them to see, and then immediately give them access to anything that they might be looking for."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"First, I think it is clear that getting the word out about Kindle Fire is a primary goal of Amazons. I like the way the product is featured with an image and a clear call-to-action without trying to say too much on the mobile home page. If you want to know more, click the Learn More link."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Secondly, it is clear that it has been detected that I am using an iPhone to reach the mobile version of the website. This has caused the mobile home page to display a call-to-action to download their iPhone applications."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,"Lastly, the navigation is brilliantly organized which is no small feat for a company that sells the wide array of products that Amazon sells. They list the most popular departments on the home page and then a link to See All Departments if you dont find what you are looking for. This allows them to serve the majority of people without cluttering up the mobile interface with links."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,We know that many of our readers are experts in design and marketing as well. We would love to hear your critique of the Amazon Mobile Home Page in the comments!
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00084,blog.crazyegg.com,I think the navigation is great. And the color scheme is transcendent of their desktop version. Amazons branding is their usability digitally at least. They are missing a huge oppertunity to harness that same gut feeling through their TV and print media

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Engaging voters online is an increasingly important part of the electoral process. The 2008 Presidential campaign saw Barack Obama and the Democratic Party rightly complimented for their effective use of web technology and social media. As the Republican presidential primary campaign continues, has the GOP learned some of those lessons? How are the four remaining candidates portraying themselves online?"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Romney makes a big mistake immediately by hiding his main website behind a very mundane splash page. The splash page is intended to encourage people to sign up for updates about the campaign, and the need for any candidate to develop a strong user list is important. But this call to action could easily have been incorporated into the main site; right now the first experience anyone has visiting Romneys campaign site is a mediocre and unattractive extra-step. Im sure its going to put off a lot of visitors."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Once you get past the splash page, Romney has a pretty appealing site. The layout is strong, and makes really effective use of imagery. Good use of white space gives a clean and professional look. Its easy to find more about Romney and his stance on the issues, as well as latest campaign news. Its also the only site that provides really visible links to state specific information for all 50 states."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"I like the very clear calls to action for the main social media services. Facebook, Twitter and Google+ options to share major stories are seamlessly integrated, and there are separate options for engaging with the candidate directly on social media. This suggests a clear understanding that theres a distinction between building social media followers, and sharing content."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Gingrichs site scores highly for usability, but doesnt have a really strong visual impact. Its well put together but very traditional in its layout and appearance. Kind of like a very standard blog template  and that means it looks dated."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Navigation is simple, and there are very clear calls to action for anyone interested in getting involved with the campaign, donating, or buying campaign related merchandise. Social media seems very much an afterthought (surprising, given that Gingrich has a massive Twitter following compared to any of the other candidates)."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"It also looks like some areas of the site arent updated often enough. As I write this, there are still sections on helping Gingrich win in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary, both events that happened a couple of weeks ago."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Ron Pauls the only candidate using WordPress for his campaign website (all the other candidates use Drupal). Initial engagement is strong. I really like his donation thermometer with a real time count, and the recent donor helps to suggest that the Paul campaign engages with individual people. It makes for a powerful call to action for donations."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"I was confused navigating around the site. The two columns of articles on the front page (one is an opinion-based Paulitical Ticker, the other is Ron Paul in the News) arent very well differentiated. The navigation bar has too many options, and the different sections of the site could be more clearly defined."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Social media integration is relatively low key, and the site is generally more wordy than the others (as, indeed, Paul is as a candidate). I think it would benefit from a larger font size, its fallen into the 12 pixel trap that might look OK at first glance but isnt that well suited to easily browsing text."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"I just dont like this website. The layout is odd, and looks very strange in larger windows; its like theyve tried to create a fluid width layout without really understanding the principle. Its blocky, a little ugly, and has bad typography. Add in a lack of any clear call to action, and Im unsure what the site is trying to achieve."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Even the language is a little unusual, with some sections written in the third person and some sections written in the first person. It gives the feeling of a made by committee website that doesnt have any strong creative vision or sense of purpose."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Of all the primary candidate websites, Santorums is the one that looks the most amateurish. The first time it took me a few moments to work out where the navigation was; the site layout works in such a way as to completely draw the eye away from that menu."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"Its clear that the leading GOP candidates have upped their game and understand the importance of a good website (former candidates John Huntsman, Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Michelle Bachmann also have reasonably polished sites). Theres still a lot of room to improve. None of the sites use any HTML 5 technology, their SEO is basic, and none of the design is particularly outstanding."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00085,blog.crazyegg.com,"The GOP candidates may have taken some steps to improve their online presence, but they have a long way to go."

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"For those that are new to Twitter hashtags, lets start with the basics."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,What are Twitter Hashtags?
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Hashtags are a way of organizing Twitter. Twitter users are able to sort tweets that contain a particular hashtag. By viewing tweets that contain a hashtag, we are able to have conversations about topics on Twitter."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"For example, any tweet with the #webdesign hashtag added to it can be easily found using Twitter.com or 3rd party tools like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,Adding a hashtag to a tweet allows it to go beyond your own network to as many people that are following that hashtag to see real time conversation about that topic.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,You can see a hashtag in action by simply tweeting this post  I used the hashtag #WebDesign in the title so everyone who tweets it will get to use one right off the bat!
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,Hashtags can be used in a variety of ways for different purposes. Some useful ways to use them include the following.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Add a hashtag to your tweets (when relevant) to get a wider audience for your update. This way, instead of just your followers seeing your latest tweet on web design, you can add #webdesign to your tweet to get anyone who is following that hashtag to see it as well."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Be on the lookout for trending topic hashtags and add them to your tweets when applicable. Use the Trending topics on your Twitter homepage to see the latest. If you are looking to target a local marketing, click on the change link to see trends within a specific location."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"If youre not sure what a particular trend is about, you can click on it to see the latest tweets or go to What the Trend to see other users explanations of why something is popular."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Want to follow hashtags in your industry? You can do it a few different ways. You could search for the hashtag on Twitter and use the Save this search button to save it on your Twitter account. But a better way to do it would be to use a Twitter management tool like HootSuite (shown above), Tweetdeck, or similar. These programs allow you to add a column to your dashboard with the hashtag and will automatically update the stream as new tweets come in."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"In HootSuite, you would click the Add Stream button, then add #webdesign as your search query under the Search tab."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"In Tweetdeck, you would click the Add Column button, select Search as the column type, and enter #webdesign in the search box."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"This is a great way to see the latest tweets on industry-related hashtags. Youll probably see everything from random quotes, popular articles, and even job listings."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Take the above tip on following industry hashtags one step further by following questions asked on a particular hashtag by using the search query #webdesign ? -filter:links. Setting this search up on Twitter, HootSuite, Tweetdeck, or similar applications will allow you to see questions asked about a particular topic (mostly) without any links in the tweet. Answer these questions to help build your authority in the web design industry!"
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,You can use sites like Paper.li which will allow you to create newspapers around hashtags. You can see this web design daily as an example.
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"As a web designer, you might be asked your opinion on using particular things such as blog platforms. Use Topsy Analytics and enter the platforms mentioned by your client as hashtags to see the number of people talking about them. The one talked about the most is probably the best choice for your client and you, as the designer, since there will be more community support."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,The following are a sampling of various design related hashtags that you can add to your own tweets or monitor within the web design industry.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"If youre debating about using different variations of a hashtag like #webdesigner, #webdesign, or #web #design, then enter all three on the earlier mentioned Topsy Analytics tool.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Hashtags are no longer only for Twitter. They are starting to gain popularity on Google+ as well.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Cool overview. Definitely find there are a lot of people out there who have a vague conception about what hashtags are, but dont really know how to use them effectively. You can find some great tweets leading to great resources by permanently or semi-permanently following certain hashtags (although I tend to find that I end up with too many Tweetdeck columns if I try and follow everything I want!)."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"If youre aiming at an external audience, be careful of the hashtags youre using. Most particularly, be aware of some of the acronyms that might be confusing. Something like #cms or #ux are easily recognizable to people within a certain industry, but perhaps youre trying to provide some resources to explain or introduce these topics; if thats the cause then the audience might not be well targeted by the use of acronyms."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Question on the paper.li; I often get tagged as having contributed to these, but I cant remember ever really getting any return traffic to my website, or Twitter follows, that are identifiably from that source. Are there any statistics on whether paper.li sites have any real audience on an individual basis? Its an interesting aggregator service, but certainly I tend to trust personally curated sites far more."
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,Good point on the acronym hashtags.   
clueweb12-0000tw-00-00086,blog.crazyegg.com,"Do you use Google Analytics?  I see paper.li and their competitors, scoop.it & summify.com in my Traffic Sources > Referral Traffic section.

Even if its not full ""B/F"", it is still one of the best value's in the system IMHO."
