ADVENTURE  I.  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

I.


To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.

"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."

"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is the writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised yourself seriously."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We have tried and failed."

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I have heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.

"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."

II.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.

" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

" 'What then?' I asked.

" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"

"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."

As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."

"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"

Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."

III.


I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to return."

"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,


"Very truly yours,              
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE


I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.

" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'

" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'

" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.

" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'

" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.

" 'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

" 'Is $4 a week.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is purely nominal.'

" 'What do you call purely nominal?'

" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'

" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.

" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.

"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:


THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSOLVED.

October 9, 1890.


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

" 'What, the red-headed man?'

" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

" 'Where could I find him?'

" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."

"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."

"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY


"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.

"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.

Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."

"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."

"No?"

"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."

"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What office?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."

"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"

The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY


We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:

"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."

"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."

We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."

"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.

"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."

"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.

"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."

"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."

He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.

"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.

"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.

"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?

"Witness: It was.

"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.

"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Coroner: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.

" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" 'Yes, it was gone.'

" 'You cannot say what it was?'

" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

" 'How far from the body?'

" 'A dozen yards or so.'

" 'And how far from the edge of the wood?'

" 'About the same.'

" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'

" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded the examination of the witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."

Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."

"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"

"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The doctor?"

"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."

"Yes, certainly."

"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."

"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."

"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."

I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."

"And what did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."

"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to

ADVENTURE  I.  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA

I.


To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.

One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then, how do you know?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession."

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds of times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't know."

"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

The note was undated, and without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"

"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written.

"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff."

"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."

I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.

"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.

"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention."

A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"

"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."

The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"And I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.

"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."

"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is the writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in the photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You have compromised yourself seriously."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We have tried and failed."

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."

"No sign of it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I have heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."

"And Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none."

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"And why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You have carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph."

"And for present expenses?"

The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.

"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."

II.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest.

"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home.

"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.

" 'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.

" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

" 'What then?' I asked.

" 'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what then?"

"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements."

"Which are?"

"Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking the law?"

"Not in the least."

"Nor running a chance of arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"Oh, the cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your man."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"And what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."

As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street.

"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."

"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"

Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could have been better. It is all right."

"You have the photograph?"

"I know where it is."

"And how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in the dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."

"And now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands."

"And when will you call?"

"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been."

III.


I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.

"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you have hopes?"

"I have hopes."

"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

"We must have a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"And why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. And yet--! Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.

The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to return."

"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,


"Very truly yours,              
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.

"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly," said Holmes.

"You have but to name it."

"This photograph!"

The King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.

ADVENTURE  II.  THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE


I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in the next room."

"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures."

"Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."

The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."

"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use an arc-and-compass breastpin."

"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after all."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."

I took the paper from him and read as follows:

"TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a salary of $4 a week for purely nominal services. All red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, of the paper and the date."

"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still with you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:

" 'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.

" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'

" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

" 'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he asked with his eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies.'

" 'And what are they worth?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it need not interfere very much with one's other occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.

" 'Tell me all about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do.'

" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who would apply.'

" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'

" 'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below, and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right.

" 'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,' said I.

" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'

" 'What would be the hours?' I asked.

" 'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see to anything that turned up.

" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'

" 'Is $4 a week.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is purely nominal.'

" 'What do you call purely nominal?'

" 'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time.'

" 'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,' said I.

" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

" 'And the work?'

" 'Is to copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is the first volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.

"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note-paper. It read in this fashion:


THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSOLVED.

October 9, 1890.


Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the ground floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.

" 'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'

" 'What, the red-headed man?'

" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

" 'Where could I find him?'

" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right away to you."

"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty pounds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he been with you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he the only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy and would come cheap."

"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still with you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."

"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make of it all?"

"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"

We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly, closing the door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"The knees of his trousers."

"And what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat the pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."

The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the Encyclopaedia down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed? Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be some $30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next. I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet."

"I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, and they are waiting for us."

We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"

The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.

"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."

"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."

"And sit in the dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.

"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."

"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no chance at all."

"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must compliment you."

"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new and effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and 'please.' "

"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to the police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."

"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The $4 a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation."

"But how could you guess what the motive was?"

"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."

"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so."

"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE OF IDENTITY


"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."

"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."

I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."

"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger.

"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems."

"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that I may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of the bell.

"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know all that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.

Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said, "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away to you."

"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."

"And your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about $60."

"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would have her way."

"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more."

"No?"

"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for father to know."

"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--and--"

"What office?"

"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on the premises."

"And you don't know his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think of."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."

"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him."

"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened."

"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"

"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again."

"And your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. And your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place of business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which were new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and, observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held the little printed slip to the light.

"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"Of what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted."

"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the denouement of the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."

"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door.

"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"

The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more obvious."

"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.

"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down and let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."

The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would have been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint."

"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest."

"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I remarked.

"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same direction."

"And how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"

"And Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world."

ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY


We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way:

"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by the 11:15."

"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"

"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I have only half an hour."

My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets."

We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.

"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."

"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families. Now for the facts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.

"From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."

"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and inference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."

"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."

"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.

"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."

"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."

He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.

"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.

"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.

"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common signal between you and your father?

"Witness: It was.

"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.

"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"The Coroner: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.

" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" 'Yes, it was gone.'

" 'You cannot say what it was?'

" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

" 'How far from the body?'

" 'A dozen yards or so.'

" 'And how far from the edge of the wood?'

" 'About the same.'

" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it?'

" 'Yes, but with my back towards it.'

"This concluded the examination of the witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against the son."

Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."

"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question of barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it. I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."

"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."

"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a union?"

"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"

"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."

"The doctor?"

"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."

"Yes, at the mines."

"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."

"Yes, certainly."

"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me."

"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel."

"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you and me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."

I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young McCarthy."

"And what did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think, sound at heart."

"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to

   TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE JAMES, BY THE GRACE OF GOD,


   KING OF GREAT BRITIAN, FRANCE, AND IRELAND,


   DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, ETC.


   THE TRANSLATORS OF THE BIBLE WISH GRACE, MERCY, AND PEACE,


   THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR Lord


   Great and manifold were the blessings, most dread Sovereign, which
   Almighty God, the Father of all mercies, bestowed upon us the people of
   England, when first he sent Your Majesty's Royal Person to rule and
   reign over us. For whereas it was the expectation of many, who wished
   not well unto our Sion, that, upon the setting of that bright
   Occindental Star, Queen Elizabeth, of most happy memory, some thick and
   palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land, that
   men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk, and that it
   should hardly be known who was to direct the unsettled State; the
   appearance of Your Majesty, as of the Sun in his strength, instantly
   dispelled those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all that
   were well affected exceeding cause of comfort; especially when we
   beheld the Government established in Your Highness, and Your hopeful
   Seed, by an undoubted Title; and this also accompanied with peace and
   tranquillity at home and abroad.

   But among all of our joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts
   than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God's sacred Word
   among us, which is that inestimable treasure which excelleth all the
   riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself, not
   only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and
   disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.

   Then not to suffer this fall to the ground, but rather to take it up,
   and to continue it in that state wherein the famous Predecessor of Your
   Highness did leave it; nay, to go forward with the confidence and
   resolution of a man, in maintaining the truth of Christ, and
   propagating it far and near is that which hath so bound and firmly knit
   the hearts of all Your Majesty's loyal and religious people unto You,
   that Your very name is precious among them: their eye doth behold You
   with comfort, and they bless You in their hearts, as that sanctified
   Person, who, under God, is the immediate author of their true
   happiness. And this their contentment doth not diminish or decay, but
   every day increaseth and taketh strength, when they observe that the
   zeal of Your Majesty toward the house of God doth not slack or go
   backward, but is more and more kindled, manifesting itself abroad in
   the farthest parts of Christendom, by writing in defence of the truth,
   (which hath given such a blow unto that Man of Sin as will not be
   healed,) and every day at home, by religious and learned discourse, by
   frequenting the house of God, by hearing the Word preached, by
   cherishing the teachers thereof, by caring for the Church, as a most
   tender and loving nursing father.

   There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and religious
   affection in Your Majesty; but none is more forcible to declare it to
   others than the vehement and perpetuated desire of accomplishing and
   publishing of this work, which now, with all humility, we present unto
   Your Majesty. For when Your Highness had once, out of deep judgement,
   apprehended how convenient it was, that, out of the Original sacred
   Tongues, together with comparing of the labours, both in our own and
   other foreign languages, of many worthy men who went before us, there
   should be one more exact translation of the Holy Scriptures into the
   English tongue; Your Majesty did never desist to urge and to excite
   those to whom it was commended, that the Work might be hastened, and
   that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner, as a matter
   of such importance might justly require.

   And now at last, by the mercy of God, and the continuance of our
   labours, it being brought unto such a conclusion, as that we have great
   hopes that the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby, we hold
   it our duty to offer it to Your Majesty, not only as to our King and
   Sovereign, but as to the principal mover and author of the Work; humbly
   craving of your most Sacred Majesty, that, since things of this quality
   have ever been subject to the censures of ill-meaning and discontented
   persons, it may receive approbation and patronage from so learned and
   judicious a Prince as Your Highness is; whose allowance and acceptance
   of our labours shall more honour and encourage us, than all the
   calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us. So
   that if, on the one side, we shall be traduced by Popish persons at
   home or abroad, who therefore will malign us, because we are poor
   instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known unto
   the people, whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness;
   or if, on the other side, we shall be maligned by self-conceited
   brethren, who run their own ways, and give liking unto nothing but what
   is framed by themselves, and hammered on their anvil, we may rest
   secure, supported within by the truth and innocency of a good
   conscience, having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity, as
   before the Lord, and sustained without by the powerful protection of
   Your Majesty's grace and favour, which will ever give countenance to
   honest and Christian endeavours against bitter censures and
   uncharitable imputations.

   The Lord of heaven and earth bless Your Majesty with many and happy
   days, that, as his heavenly hand hath enriched Your Highness with many
   singular and extraordinary graces, so You may be the wonder of the
   world in this latter age for happiness and true felicity, to the honour
   of that great God, and the good of his Church, through Jesus Christ our
   Lord and only Saviour.

THE TRANSLATORS TO THE READER
Preface to the King James Version of 1611

  THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED

   Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything
   ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured by others,
   deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold
   entertainment in the world. It is welcomed with suspicion instead of
   love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole
   left for cavil to enter, (and cavil, if it do not find a hole, will
   make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.
   This will easily be granted by as many as know story, or have any
   experience. For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of
   newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying,
   or opposition? A man would think that Civility, wholesome Laws,
   learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak
   of no more things of this kind) should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and
   out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor
   dog move his tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we
   are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the
   second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and
   from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by violence; By the third,
   we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling
   that we have attained unto ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being
   brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our
   differences than by writings which are endless; And lastly, that the
   Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and
   conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill
   their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing fathers and
   mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon
   their breasts (and upon whose breasts again themselves do hang to
   receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and
   support fit for their estates. Thus it is apparent, that these things
   which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none,
   either without absurdity can speak against them, or without note of
   wickedness can spurn against them.

   Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis
   with others] have been brought to untimely death for none other fault,
   but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline;
   and that in some Commonwealths [e.g. Locri] it was made a capital
   crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an
   old, though the same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the
   elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of
   Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way
   to good Letters and refined speech, but bare themselves as averse from
   them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no
   babe, but a great clerk [Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in
   writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he
   gave forth, that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or
   meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against
   Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and
   messengers of the great King of Kings should be furnished, it is not
   unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better
   by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], though superstitious) was devised;
   Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of
   Christianity in the Church of Rome, then a true Church, were liberally
   endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying: Now is poison
   poured down into the Church, etc. Thus not only as oft as we speak, as
   one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or consequence, we
   subject ourselves to everyone's censure, and happy is he that is least
   tossed upon tongues; for utterly to escape the snatch of them it is
   impossible. If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the
   meaner sort only, and that Princes are privileged by their high estate,
   he is deceived. "As the sword devoureth as well one as the other," as
   it is in Samuel [2 Sam 11:25], nay as the great Commander charged his
   soldiers in a certain battle, to strike at no part of the enemy, but at
   the face; And as the King of Syria commanded his chief Captains to
   "fight neither with small nor great, save only against the King of
   Israel:" [1 Kings 22:31] so it is too true, that Envy striketh most
   spitefully at the fairest, and at the chiefest. David was a worthy
   Prince, and no man to be compared to him for his first deeds, and yet
   for as worthy as act as ever he did (even for bringing back the Ark of
   God in solemnity) he was scorned and scoffed at by his own wife [2 Sam
   6:16]. Solomon was greater than David, though not in virtue, yet in
   power: and by his power and wisdom he built a Temple to the Lord, such
   a one as was the glory of the land of Israel, and the wonder of the
   whole world. But was that his magnificence liked of by all? We doubt
   it. Otherwise, why do they lay it in his son's dish, and call unto him
   for easing the burden, "Make", say they, "the grievous servitude of thy
   father, and his sore yoke, lighter?" [1 Kings 12:4] Belike he had
   charged them with some levies, and troubled them with some carriages;
   Hereupon they raise up a tragedy, and wish in their heart the Temple
   had never been built. So hard a thing it is to please all, even when we
   please God best, and do seek to approve ourselves to every ones
   conscience.

   If we will descend to later times, we shall find many the like examples
   of such kind, or rather unkind acceptance. The first Roman Emperor [C.
   Caesar. Plutarch] did never do a more pleasing deed to the learned, nor
   more profitable to posterity, for conserving the record of times in
   true supputation; than when he corrected the Calendar, and ordered the
   year according to the course of the Sun; and yet this was imputed to
   him for novelty, and arrogance, and procured to him great obloguy. So
   the first Christened Emperor [Constantine] (at the least-wise that
   openly professed the faith himself, and allowed others to do the like)
   for strengthening the Empire at his great charges, and providing for
   the Church, as he did, got for his labour the name Pupillus, as who
   would say, a wasteful Prince, that had need of a Guardian or overseer
   [Aurel. Victor]. So the best Christened Emperor [Theodosius], for the
   love that he bare unto peace, thereby to enrich both himself and his
   subjects, and because he did not see war but find it, was judged to be
   no man at arms [Zosimus], (though indeed he excelled in feats of
   chivalry, and showed so much when he was provoked) and condemned for
   giving himself to his ease, and to his pleasure. To be short, the most
   learned Emperor of former times [Justinian], (at the least, the
   greatest politician) what thanks had he for cutting off the
   superfluities of the laws, and digesting them into some order and
   method? This, that he had been blotted by some to be an Epitomist, that
   is, one that extinguishes worthy whole volumes, to bring his
   abridgments into request. This is the measure that hath been rendered
   to excellent Princes in former times, even, Cum bene facerent, male
   audire, For their good deeds to be evil spoken of. Neither is there any
   likelihood, that envy and malignity died, and were buried with the
   ancient. No, no, the reproof of Moses taketh hold of most ages; "You
   are risen up in your fathers' stead, and increase of sinful men." [Num
   32:14] "What is that that hath been done? that which shall be done; and
   there is no new thing under the Sun," saith the wiseman: [Ecc 1:9] and
   S. Stephen, "As your fathers did, so do you." [Acts 7:51]

    HIS MAJESTY'S CONSTANCY, NOTWITHSTANDING CULMINATION, FOR THE SURVEY OF THE
    ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS

   This, and more to this purpose, His Majesty that now reigneth (and
   long, and long may he reign, and his offspring forever, "Himself and
   children, and children's always) knew full well, according to the
   singular wisdom given unto him by God, and the rare learning and
   experience that he hath attained unto; namely that whosoever attempteth
   anything for the public (especially if it pertain to Religion, and to
   the opening and clearing of the word of God) the same setteth himself
   upon a stage to be gloated upon by every evil eye, yea, he casteth
   himself headlong upon pikes, to be gored by every sharp tongue. For he
   that medleth with men's Religion in any part, medleth with their
   custom, nay, with their freehold; and though they find no content in
   that which they have, yet they cannot abide to hear of altering.
   Notwithstanding his Royal heart was not daunted or discouraged for this
   that colour, but stood resolute, "as a statue immovable, and an anvil
   not easy to be beaten into plates," as one [Suidas] saith; he knew who
   had chosen him to be a Soldier, or rather a Captain, and being assured
   that the course which he intended made for the glory of God, and the
   building up of his Church, he would not suffer it to be broken off for
   whatsoever speeches or practices. It doth certainly belong unto Kings,
   yea, it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea,
   it doth specially belong unto them, to have care of Religion, yea, to
   know it aright, yea, to profess it zealously, yea to promote it to the
   uttermost of their power. This is their glory before all nations which
   mean well, and this will bring unto them a far most excellent weight of
   glory in the day of the Lord Jesus. For the Scripture saith not in
   vain, "Them that honor me, I will honor," [1 Sam 2:30] neither was it a
   vain word that Eusebius delivered long ago, that piety towards God was
   the weapon and the only weapon, that both preserved Constantine's
   person, and avenged him of his enemies [Eusebius lib 10 cap 8].

    THE PRAISE OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES

   But now what piety without truth? what truth (what saving truth)
   without the word of God? What word of God (whereof we may be sure)
   without the Scripture? The Scriptures we are commanded to search. John
   5:39. Isa 8:20. They are commended that searched and studied them. Acts
   17:11 and 8:28,29. They are reproved that were unskillful in them, or
   slow to believe them. Matt 22:29. Luke 24:25. They can make us wise
   unto salvation. 2 Tim 3:15. If we be ignorant, they will instruct us;
   if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of order, they will
   reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull, quicken us; if cold,
   inflame us. Tolle, lege; Tolle, lege, Take up and read, take up and
   read the Scriptures [S. August. confess. lib 8 cap 12], (for unto them
   was the direction) it was said unto S. Augustine by a supernatural
   voice. "Whatsoever is in the Scriptures, believe me," saith the same S.
   Augustine, "is high and divine; there is verily truth, and a doctrine
   most fit for the refreshing of men's minds, and truly so tempered, that
   everyone may draw from thence that which is sufficient for him, if he
   come to draw with a devout and pious mind, as true Religion requireth."
   [S. August. de utilitcredendi cap. 6] Thus S. Augustine. and S. Jerome:
   "Ama scripturas, et amabit te sapientia etc." [S. Jerome. ad Demetriad]
   Love the Scriptures, and wisdom will love thee. And S. Cyril against
   Julian; "Even boys that are bred up in the Scriptures, become most
   religious, etc. [S. Cyril. 7 contra Iulianum] But what mention we three
   or four uses of the Scripture, whereas whatsoever is to be believed or
   practiced, or hoped for, is contained in them? or three or four
   sentences of the Fathers, since whosoever is worthy the name of a
   Father, from Christ's time downward, hath likewise written not only of
   the riches, but also of the perfection of the Scripture? "I adore the
   fulness of the Scripture," saith Tertullian against Hermogenes.
   [Tertul. advers. Hermo.] And again, to Apelles an heretic of the like
   stamp, he saith; "I do not admit that which thou bringest in (or
   concludest) of thine own (head or store, de tuo) without Scripture."
   [Tertul. de carne Christi.] So Saint Justin Martyr before him; "We must
   know by all means," saith he, "that it is not lawful (or possible) to
   learn (anything) of God or of right piety, save only out of the
   Prophets, who teach us by divine inspiration." So Saint Basil after
   Tertullian, "It is a manifest falling way from the Faith, and a fault
   of presumption, either to reject any of those things that are written,
   or to bring in (upon the head of them) any of those things that are not
   written. We omit to cite to the same effect, S. Cyril B. of Jerusalem
   in his 4::Cataches., Saint Jerome against Helvidius, Saint Augustine in
   his 3::book against the letters of Petilian, and in very many other
   places of his works. Also we forebear to descend to later Fathers,
   because we will not weary the reader. The Scriptures then being
   acknowledged to be so full and so perfect, how can we excuse ourselves
   of negligence, if we do not study them, of curiosity, if we be not
   content with them? Men talk much of [an olive bow wrapped about with
   wood, whereupon did hang figs, and bread, honey in a pot, and oil], how
   many sweet and goodly things it had hanging on it; of the Philosopher's
   stone, that it turned copper into gold; of Cornucopia, that it had all
   things necessary for food in it, of Panaces the herb, that it was good
   for diseases, of Catholicon the drug, that it is instead of all purges;
   of Vulcan's armor, that it was an armor of proof against all thrusts,
   and all blows, etc. Well, that which they falsely or vainly attributed
   to these things for bodily god, we may justly and with full measure
   ascribe unto the Scripture, for spiritual. It is not only an armor, but
   also a whole armory of weapons, both offensive and defensive; whereby
   we may save ourselves and put the enemy to flight. It is not an herb,
   but a tree, or rather a whole paradise of trees of life, which bring
   forth fruit every month, and the fruit thereof is for meat, and the
   leaves for medicine. It is not a pot of Manna, or a cruse of oil, which
   were for memory only, or for a meal's meat or two, but as it were a
   shower of heavenly bread sufficient for a whole host, be it never so
   great; and as it were a whole cellar full of oil vessels; whereby all
   our necessities may be provided for, and our debts discharged. In a
   word, it is a Panary of wholesome food, against fenowed traditions; a
   Physician's shop (Saint Basil called it) [S. Basil in Psal. primum.] of
   preservatives against poisoned heresies; a Pandect of profitable laws,
   against rebellious spirits; a treasury of most costly jewels, against
   beggarly rudiments; finally a fountain of most pure water springing up
   unto everlasting life. And what marvel? The original thereof being from
   heaven, not from earth; the author being God, not man; the inditer, the
   holy spirit, not the wit of the Apostles or Prophets; the Penmen such
   as were sanctified from the womb, and endued with a principal portion
   of God's spirit; the matter, verity, piety, purity, uprightness; the
   form, God's word, God's testimony, God's oracles, the word of truth,
   the word of salvation, etc.; the effects, light of understanding,
   stableness of persuasion, repentance from dead works, newness of life,
   holiness, peace, joy in the holy Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of
   the study thereof, fellowship with the Saints, participation of the
   heavenly nature, fruition of an inheritance immortal, undefiled, and
   that never shall fade away: Happy is the man that delighted in the
   Scripture, and thrice happy that meditateth in it day and night.

    TRANSLATION NECESSARY

   But how shall men meditate in that, which they cannot understand? How
   shall they understand that which is kept close in an unknown tongue? as
   it is written, "Except I know the power of the voice, I shall be to him
   that speaketh, a Barbarian, and he that speaketh, shall be a Barbarian
   to me." [1 Cor 14] The Apostle excepteth no tongue; not Hebrew the
   ancientest, not Greek the most copious, not Latin the finest. Nature
   taught a natural man to confess, that all of us in those tongues which
   we do not understand, are plainly deaf; we may turn the deaf ear unto
   them. The Scythian counted the Athenian, whom he did not understand,
   barbarous; [Clem. Alex. 1 Strom.] so the Roman did the Syrian, and the
   Jew (even S. Jerome himself called the Hebrew tongue barbarous, belike
   because it was strange to so many) [S. Jerome. Damaso.] so the Emperor
   of Constantinople [Michael, Theophili fil.] calleth the Latin tongue,
   barbarous, though Pope Nicolas do storm at it: [2::Tom. Concil. ex
   edit. Petri Crab] so the Jews long before Christ called all other
   nations, Lognazim, which is little better than barbarous. Therefore as
   one complaineth, that always in the Senate of Rome, there was one or
   other that called for an interpreter: [Cicero 5::de finibus.] so lest
   the Church be driven to the like exigent, it is necessary to have
   translations in a readiness. Translation it is that openeth the window,
   to let in the light; that breaketh the shell, that we may eat the
   kernel; that putteth aside the curtain, that we may look into the most
   Holy place; that removeth the cover of the well, that we may come by
   the water, even as Jacob rolled away the stone from the mouth of the
   well, by which means the flocks of Laban were watered [Gen 29:10].
   Indeed without translation into the vulgar tongue, the unlearned are
   but like children at Jacob's well (which is deep) [John 4:11] without a
   bucket or something to draw with; or as that person mentioned by
   Isaiah, to whom when a sealed book was delivered, with this motion,
   "Read this, I pray thee," he was fain to make this answer, "I cannot,
   for it is sealed." [Isa 29:11]

    THE TRANSLATION OF THE OLD TESTAMENT OUT OF THE HEBREW INTO GREEK

   While God would be known only in Jacob, and have his Name great in
   Israel, and in none other place, while the dew lay on Gideon's fleece
   only, and all the earth besides was dry; then for one and the same
   people, which spake all of them the language of Canaan, that is,
   Hebrew, one and the same original in Hebrew was sufficient. [S. August.
   lib 12 contra Faust c32] But, when the fulness of time drew near, that
   the Sun of righteousness, the Son of God should come into the world,
   whom God ordained to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood,
   not of the Jew only, but also of the Greek, yea, of all them that were
   scattered abroad; then lo, it pleased the Lord to stir up the spirit of
   a Greek Prince (Greek for descent and language) even of Ptolemy
   Philadelph King of Egypt, to procure the translating of the Book of God
   out of Hebrew into Greek. This is the translation of the Seventy
   Interpreters, commonly so called, which prepared the way for our
   Saviour among the Gentiles by written preaching, as Saint John Baptist
   did among the Jews by vocal. For the Grecians being desirous of
   learning, were not wont to suffer books of worth to lie moulding in
   Kings' libraries, but had many of their servants, ready scribes, to
   copy them out, and so they were dispersed and made common. Again, the
   Greek tongue was well known and made familiar to most inhabitants in
   Asia, by reason of the conquest that there the Grecians had made, as
   also by the Colonies, which thither they had sent. For the same causes
   also it was well understood in many places of Europe, yea, and of
   Africa too. Therefore the word of God being set forth in Greek,
   becometh hereby like a candle set upon a candlestick, which giveth
   light to all that are in the house, or like a proclamation sounded
   forth in the market place, which most men presently take knowledge of;
   and therefore that language was fittest to contain the Scriptures, both
   for the first Preachers of the Gospel to appeal unto for witness, and
   for the learners also of those times to make search and trial by. It is
   certain, that that Translation was not so sound and so perfect, but it
   needed in many places correction; and who had been so sufficient for
   this work as the Apostles or Apostolic men? Yet it seemed good to the
   holy Ghost and to them, to take that which they found, (the same being
   for the greatest part true and sufficient) rather than making a new, in
   that new world and green age of the Church, to expose themselves to
   many exceptions and cavillations, as though they made a Translations to
   serve their own turn, and therefore bearing a witness to themselves,
   their witness not to be regarded. This may be supposed to be some
   cause, why the Translation of the Seventy was allowed to pass for
   current. Notwithstanding, though it was commended generally, yet it did
   not fully content the learned, no not of the Jews. For not long after
   Christ, Aquila fell in hand with a new Translation, and after him
   Theodotion, and after him Symmachus; yea, there was a fifth and a sixth
   edition, the Authors whereof were not known. [Epiphan. de mensur. et
   ponderibus.] These with the Seventy made up the Hexapla and were
   worthily and to great purpose compiled together by Origen. Howbeit the
   Edition of the Seventy went away with the credit, and therefore not
   only was placed in the midst by Origen (for the worth and excellency
   thereof above the rest, as Epiphanius gathered) but also was used by
   the Greek fathers for the ground and foundation of their Commentaries.
   Yea, Epiphanius above named doeth attribute so much unto it, that he
   holdeth the Authors thereof not only for Interpreters, but also for
   Prophets in some respect [S. August. 2::de dectrin. Christian c. 15];
   and Justinian the Emperor enjoining the Jews his subjects to use
   especially the Translation of the Seventy, rendreth this reason
   thereof, because they were as it were enlightened with prophetical
   grace. Yet for all that, as the Egyptians are said of the Prophet to be
   men and not God, and their horses flesh and not spirit [Isa 31:3]; so
   it is evident, (and Saint Jerome affirmeth as much) [S. Jerome. de
   optimo genere interpret.] that the Seventy were Interpreters, they were
   not Prophets; they did many things well, as learned men; but yet as men
   they stumbled and fell, one while through oversight, another while
   through ignorance, yea, sometimes they may be noted to add to the
   Original, and sometimes to take from it; which made the Apostles to
   leave them many times, when they left the Hebrew, and to deliver the
   sense thereof according to the truth of the word, as the spirit gave
   them utterance. This may suffice touching the Greek Translations of the
   Old Testament.

    TRANSLATION OUT OF HEBREW AND GREEK INTO LATIN

   There were also within a few hundred years after CHRIST, translations
   many into the Latin tongue: for this tongue also was very fit to convey
   the Law and the Gospel by, because in those times very many Countries
   of the West, yea of the South, East and North, spake or understood
   Latin, being made Provinces to the Romans. But now the Latin
   Translations were too many to be all good, for they were infinite
   (Latini Interprets nullo modo numerari possunt, saith S. Augustine.)
   [S. Augustin. de doctr. Christ. lib 2 cap II]. Again they were not out
   of the Hebrew fountain (we speak of the Latin Translations of the Old
   Testament) but out of the Greek stream, therefore the Greek being not
   altogether clear, the Latin derived from it must needs be muddy. This
   moved S. Jerome a most learned father, and the best linguist without
   controversy, of his age, or of any that went before him, to undertake
   the translating of the Old Testament, out of the very fountain with
   that evidence of great learning, judgment, industry, and faithfulness,
   that he had forever bound the Church unto him, in a debt of special
   remembrance and thankfulness.

    THE TRANSLATING OF THE SCRIPTURE INTO THE VULGAR TONGUES

   Now through the Church were thus furnished with Greek and Latin
   Translations, even before the faith of CHRIST was generally embraced in
   the Empire; (for the learned know that even in S. Jerome's time, the
   Consul of Rome and his wife were both Ethnics, and about the same time
   the greatest part of the Senate also) [S. Jerome. Marcell.Zosim] yet
   for all that the godly-learned were not content to have the Scriptures
   in the Language which they themselves understood, Greek and Latin, (as
   the good Lepers were not content to fare well themselves, but
   acquainted their neighbors with the store that God had sent, that they
   also might provide for themselves) [2 Kings 7:9] but also for the
   behoof and edifying of the unlearned which hungered and thirsted after
   righteousness, and had souls to be saved as well as they, they provided
   Translations into the vulgar for their Countrymen, insomuch that most
   nations under heaven did shortly after their conversion, hear CHRIST
   speaking unto them in their mother tongue, not by the voice of their
   Minister only, but also by the written word translated. If any doubt
   hereof, he may be satisfied by examples enough, if enough will serve
   the turn. First S. Jerome saith, Multarum gentium linguis Scriptura
   ante translata, docet falsa esse quae addita sunt, etc. i.e. "The
   Scripture being translated before in the languages of many Nations,
   doth show that those things that were added (by Lucian and Hesychius)
   are false." [S. Jerome. praef. in 4::Evangel.] So S. Jerome in that
   place. The same Jerome elsewhere affirmeth that he, the time was, had
   set forth the translation of the Seventy suae linguae hominibus, i.e.,
   for his countrymen of Dalmatia [S. Jerome. Sophronio.] Which words not
   only Erasmus doth understand to purport, that S. Jerome translated the
   Scripture into the Dalmatian tongue, but also Sixtus Senensis [Six.
   Sen. lib 4], and Alphonsus a` Castro [Alphon. lb 1 ca 23] (that we
   speak of no more) men not to be excepted against by them of Rome, do
   ingenuously confess as much. So, S. Chrysostom that lived in S.
   Jerome's time, giveth evidence with him: "The doctrine of S. John
   [saith he] did not in such sort [as the Philosophers' did] vanish away:
   but the Syrians, Egyptians, Indians, Persians, Ethiopians, and infinite
   other nations being barbarous people translated it into their [mother]
   tongue, and have learned to be [true] Philosophers," he meaneth
   Christians. [S. Chrysost. in Johan. cap.I. hom.I.] To this may be added
   Theodoret, as next unto him, both for antiquity, and for learning. His
   words be these, "Every Country that is under the Sun, is full of these
   words (of the Apostles and Prophets) and the Hebrew tongue [he meaneth
   the Scriptures in the Hebrew tongue] is turned not only into the
   Language of the Grecians, but also of the Romans, and Egyptians, and
   Persians, and Indians, and Armenians, and Scythians, and Sauromatians,
   and briefly into all the Languages that any Nation useth. [Theodor. 5.
   Therapeut.] So he. In like manner, Ulfilas is reported by Paulus
   Diaconus and Isidor (and before them by Sozomen) to have translated the
   Scriptures into the Gothic tongue: [P. Diacon. li. 12.] John Bishop of
   Sevil by Vasseus, to have turned them into Arabic, about the year of
   our Lord 717; [Vaseus in Chron. Hispan.] Bede by Cistertiensis, to have
   turned a great part of them into Saxon: Efnard by Trithemius, to have
   abridged the French Psalter, as Beded had done the Hebrew, about the
   year 800: King Alfred by the said Cistertiensis, to have turned the
   Psalter into Saxon: [Polydor. Virg. 5 histor.] Methodius by Aventinus
   (printed at Ingolstadt) to have turned the Scriptures into Slavonian:
   [Aventin. lib. 4.] Valdo, Bishop of Frising by Beatus Rhenanus, to have
   caused about that time, the Gospels to be translated into Dutch rhythm,
   yet extant in the Library of Corbinian: [Circa annum 900. B. Rhenan.
   rerum German. lib 2.] Valdus, by divers to have turned them himself
   into French, about the year 1160: Charles the Fifth of that name,
   surnamed the Wise, to have caused them to be turned into French, about
   200 years after Valdus his time, of which translation there be many
   copies yet extant, as witnesseth Beroaldus. Much about that time, even
   in our King Richard the second's days, John Trevisa translated them
   into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be
   seen with divers, translated as it is very probable, in that age. So
   the Syrian translation of the New Testament is in most learned men's
   Libraries, of Widminstadius his setting forth, and the Psalter in
   Arabic is with many, of Augustinus Nebiensis' setting forth. So Postel
   affirmeth, that in his travel he saw the Gospels in the Ethiopian
   tongue; And Ambrose Thesius allegeth the Pslater of the Indians, which
   he testifieth to have been set forth by Potken in Syrian characters. So
   that, to have the Scriptures in the mother tongue is not a quaint
   conceit lately taken up, either by the Lord Cromwell in England,
   [Thuan.] or by the Lord Radevile in Polony, or by the Lord Ungnadius in
   the Emperor's dominion, but hath been thought upon, and put in practice
   of old, even from the first times of the conversion of any Nation; no
   doubt, because it was esteemed most profitable, to cause faith to grow
   in men's hearts the sooner, and to make them to be able to say with the
   words of the Psalms, "As we have heard, so we have seen." [Ps 48:8]

    THE UNWILLINGNESS OF OUR CHIEF ADVERSARIES, THAT THE SCRIPTURES SHOULD BE
    DIVULGED IN THE MOTHER TONGUE, ETC.

   Now the Church of Rome would seem at the length to bear a motherly
   affection towards her children, and to allow them the Scriptures in
   their mother tongue: but indeed it is a gift, not deserving to be
   called a gift, an unprofitable gift: [Sophecles] they must first get a
   licence in writing before they may use them, and to get that, they must
   approve themselves to their Confessor, that is, to be such as are, if
   not frozen in the dregs, yet soured with the leaven of their
   superstition. Howbeit, it seemed too much to Clement the Eighth that
   there should be any Licence granted to have them in the vulgar tongue,
   and therefore he overruleth and frustrateth the grant of Pius the
   Fourth. [See the observation (set forth by Clemen. His authority) upon
   the 4. rule of Pius the 4. his making in the index, lib. prohib. pag.
   15. ver. 5.] So much are they afraid of the light of the Scripture,
   (Lucifugae Scripturarum, as Tertulian speaketh) that they will not
   trust the people with it, no not as it is set forth by their own sworn
   men, no not with the Licence of their own Bishops and Inquisitors. Yea,
   so unwilling they are to communicate the Scriptures to the people's
   understanding in any sort, that they are not ashamed to confess, that
   we forced them to translate it into English against their wills. This
   seemeth to argue a bad cause, or a bad conscience, or both. Sure we
   are, that it is not he that hath good gold, that is afraid to bring it
   to the touchstone, but he that hath the counterfeit; [Tertul. de resur.
   carnis.] neither is it the true man that shunneth the light, but the
   malefactor, lest his deeds should be reproved [John 3:20]: neither is
   it the plaindealing Merchant that is unwilling to have the weights, or
   the meteyard brought in place, but he that useth deceit. But we will
   let them alone for this fault, and return to translation.

    THE SPEECHES AND REASONS, BOTH OF OUR BRETHREN, AND OF OUR ADVERSARIES
    AGAINST THIS WORK

   Many men's mouths have been open a good while (and yet are not stopped)
   with speeches about the Translation so long in hand, or rather perusals
   of Translations made before: and ask what may be the reason, what the
   necessity of the employment: Hath the Church been deceived, say they,
   all this while? Hath her sweet bread been mingled with leaven, here
   silver with dross, her wine with water, her milk with lime? (Lacte
   gypsum male miscetur, saith S. Ireney,) [S. Iren. 3. lib. cap. 19.] We
   hoped that we had been in the right way, that we had the Oracles of God
   delivered unto us, and that though all the world had cause to be
   offended and to complain, yet that we had none. Hath the nurse holden
   out the breast, and nothing but wind in it? Hath the bread been
   delivered by the fathers of the Church, and the same proved to be
   lapidosus, as Seneca speaketh? What is it to handle the word of God
   deceitfully, if this be not? Thus certain brethren. Also the
   adversaries of Judah and Jerusalem, like Sanballat in Nehemiah, mock,
   as we hear, both the work and the workmen, saying; "What do these weak
   Jews, etc. will they make the stones whole again out of the heaps of
   dust which are burnt? although they build, yet if a fox go up, he shall
   even break down their stony wall." [Neh 4:3] Was their Translation good
   before? Why do they now mend it? Was it not good? Why then was it
   obtruded to the people? Yea, why did the Catholics (meaning Popish
   Romanists) always go in jeopardy, for refusing to go to hear it? Nay,
   if it must be translated into English, Catholics are fittest to do it.
   They have learning, and they know when a thing is well, they can manum
   de tabula. We will answer them both briefly: and the former, being
   brethren, thus, with S. Jerome, "Damnamus veteres? Mineme, sed post
   priorum studia in domo Domini quod possums laboramus." [S. Jerome.
   Apolog. advers. Ruffin.] That is, "Do we condemn the ancient? In no
   case: but after the endeavors of them that were before us, we take the
   best pains we can in the house of God." As if he said, Being provoked
   by the example of the learned men that lived before my time, I have
   thought it my duty, to assay whether my talent in the knowledge of the
   tongues, may be profitable in any measure to God's Church, lest I
   should seem to laboured in them in vain, and lest I should be thought
   to glory in men, (although ancient,) above that which was in them. Thus
   S. Jerome may be thought to speak.

    A SATISFACTION TO OUR BRETHREN

   And to the same effect say we, that we are so far off from condemning
   any of their labors that travailed before us in this kind, either in
   this land or beyond sea, either in King Henry's time, or King Edward's
   (if there were any translation, or correction of a translation in his
   time) or Queen Elizabeth's of ever renowned memory, that we acknowledge
   them to have been raised up of God, for the building and furnishing of
   his Church, and that they deserve to be had of us and of posterity in
   everlasting remembrance. The judgment of Aristotle is worthy and well
   known: "If Timotheus had not been, we had not had much sweet music; but
   if Phrynis [Timotheus his master] had not been, we had not had
   Timotheus." Therefore blessed be they, and most honoured be their name,
   that break the ice, and giveth onset upon that which helpeth forward to
   the saving of souls. Now what can be more available thereto, than to
   deliver God's book unto God's people in a tongue which they understand?
   Since of a hidden treasure, and of a fountain that is sealed, there is
   no profit, as Ptolemy Philadelph wrote to the Rabbins or masters of the
   Jews, as witnesseth Epiphanius: [S. Epiphan. loco ante citato.] and as
   S. Augustine saith; "A man had rather be with his dog than with a
   stranger (whose tongue is strange unto him)." [S. Augustin. lib. 19. de
   civil. Dei. c. 7.] Yet for all that, as nothing is begun and perfected
   at the same time, and the later thoughts are thought to be the wiser:
   so, if we building upon their foundation that went before us, and being
   holpen by their labours, do endeavor to make that better which they
   left so good; no man, we are sure, hath cause to mislike us; they, we
   persuade ourselves, if they were alive, would thank us. The vintage of
   Abienzer, that strake the stroke: yet the gleaning of grapes of Ephraim
   was not to be despised. See Judges 8:2. Joash the king of Israel did
   not satisfy himself, till he had smitten the ground three times; and
   yet he offended the Prophet, for giving over then. [2 Kings 13:18-19]
   Aquila, of whom we spake before, translated the Bible as carefully, and
   as skilfully as he could; and yet he thought good to go over it again,
   and then it got the credit with the Jews, to be called accurately done,
   as Saint Jerome witnesseth. [S. Jerome. in Ezech. cap. 3.] How many
   books of profane learning have been gone over again and again, by the
   same translators, by others? Of one and the same book of Aristotle's
   Ethics, there are extant not so few as six or seven several
   translations. Now if this cost may be bestowed upon the gourd, which
   affordeth us a little shade, and which today flourisheth, but tomorrow
   is cut down; what may we bestow, nay what ought we not to bestow upon
   the Vine, the fruit whereof maketh glad the conscience of man, and the
   stem whereof abideth forever? And this is the word of God, which we
   translate. "What is the chaff to the wheat, saith the Lord?" [Jer
   23:28] Tanti vitreum, quanti verum margaritum (saith Tertullian,)
   [Tertul. ad Martyr.] if a toy of glass be of that reckoning with us,
   how ought we to value the true pearl? [Jerome. ad Salvin.] Therefore
   let no man's eye be evil, because his Majesty's is good; neither let
   any be grieved, that we have a Prince that seeketh the increase of the
   spiritual wealth of Israel (let Sanballats and Tobiahs do so, which
   therefore do bear their just reproof) but let us rather bless God from
   the ground of our heart, for working this religious care in him, to
   have the translations of the Bible maturely considered of and examined.
   For by this means it cometh to pass, that whatsoever is sound already
   (and all is sound for substance, in one or other of our editions, and
   the worst of ours far better than their authentic vulgar) the same will
   shine as gold more brightly, being rubbed and polished; also, if
   anything be halting, or superfluous, or not so agreeable to the
   original, the same may be corrected, and the truth set in place. And
   what can the King command to be done, that will bring him more true
   honour than this? and wherein could they that have been set a work,
   approve their duty to the King, yea their obedience to God, and love to
   his Saints more, than by yielding their service, and all that is within
   them, for the furnishing of the work? But besides all this, they were
   the principal motives of it, and therefore ought least to quarrel it:
   for the very Historical truth is, that upon the importunate petitions
   of the Puritans, at his Majesty's coming to this Crown, the Conference
   at Hampton Court having been appointed for hearing their complaints:
   when by force of reason they were put from other grounds, they had
   recourse at the last, to this shift, that they could not with good
   conscience subscribe to the Communion book, since it maintained the
   Bible as it was there translated, which was as they said, a most
   corrupted translation. And although this was judged to be but a very
   poor and empty shift; yet even hereupon did his Majesty begin to
   bethink himself of the good that might ensue by a new translation, and
   presently after gave order for this Translation which is now presented
   unto thee. Thus much to satisfy our scrupulous Brethren.

    AN ANSWER TO THE IMPUTATIONS OF OUR ADVERSARIES

   Now to the latter we answer; that we do not deny, nay we affirm and
   avow, that the very meanest translation of the Bible in English, set
   forth by men of our profession, (for we have seen none of theirs of the
   whole Bible as yet) containeth the word of God, nay, is the word of
   God. As the King's speech, which he uttereth in Parliament, being
   translated into French, Dutch, Italian, and Latin, is still the King's
   speech, though it be not interpreted by every Translator with the like
   grace, nor peradventure so fitly for phrase, nor so expressly for
   sense, everywhere. For it is confessed, that things are to take their
   denomination of the greater part; and a natural man could say, Verum
   ubi multa nitent in carmine, non ego paucis offendor maculis, etc.
   [Horace.] A man may be counted a virtuous man, though he have made many
   slips in his life, (else, there were none virtuous, for in many things
   we offend all) [James 3:2] also a comely man and lovely, though he have
   some warts upon his hand, yea, not only freckles upon his face, but
   also scars. No cause therefore why the word translated should be denied
   to be the word, or forbidden to be current, notwithstanding that some
   imperfections and blemishes may be noted in the setting forth of it.
   For whatever was perfect under the Sun, where Apostles or Apostolic
   men, that is, men endued with an extraordinary measure of God's spirit,
   and privileged with the privilege of infallibility, had not their hand?
   The Romanists therefore in refusing to hear, and daring to burn the
   Word translated, did no less than despite the spirit of grace, from
   whom originally it proceeded, and whose sense and meaning, as well as
   man's weakness would enable, it did express. Judge by an example or
   two. Plutarch writeth, that after that Rome had been burnt by the
   Gauls, they fell soon to build it again: but doing it in haste, they
   did not cast the streets, nor proportion the houses in such comely
   fashion, as had been most slightly and convenient; [Plutarch in
   Camillo.] was Catiline therefore an honest man, or a good patriot, that
   sought to bring it to a combustion? or Nero a good Prince, that did
   indeed set it on fire? So, by the story of Ezra, and the prophecy of
   Haggai it may be gathered, that the Temple built by Zerubbabel after
   the return from Babylon, was by no means to be compared to the former
   built by Solomon (for they that remembered the former, wept when they
   considered the latter) [Ezra 3:12] notwithstanding, might this latter
   either have been abhorred and forsaken by the Jews, or profaned by the
   Greeks? The like we are to think of Translations. The translation of
   the Seventy dissenteth from the Original in many places, neither doth
   it come near it, for perspicuity, gravity, majesty; yet which of the
   Apostles did condemn it? Condemn it? Nay, they used it, (as it is
   apparent, and as Saint Jerome and most learned men do confess) which
   they would not have done, nor by their example of using it, so grace
   and commend it to the Church, if it had been unworthy of the
   appellation and name of the word of God. And whereas they urge for
   their second defence of their vilifying and abusing of the English
   Bibles, or some pieces thereof, which they meet with, for that heretics
   (forsooth) were the Authors of the translations, (heretics they call us
   by the same right that they call themselves Catholics, both being
   wrong) we marvel what divinity taught them so. We are sure Tertullian
   was of another mind: Ex personis probamus fidem, an ex fide personas?
   [Tertul. de praescript. contra haereses.] Do we try men's faith by
   their persons? we should try their persons by their faith. Also S.
   Augustine was of another mind: for he lighting upon certain rules made
   by Tychonius a Donatist, for the better understanding of the word, was
   not ashamed to make use of them, yea, to insert them into his own book,
   with giving commendation to them so far forth as they were worthy to be
   commended, as is to be seen in S. Augustine's third book De doctrina
   Christiana. [S. August. 3. de doct. Christ. cap. 30.] To be short,
   Origen, and the whole Church of God for certain hundred years, were of
   another mind: for they were so far from treading under foot, (much more
   from burning) the Translation of Aquila a Proselyte, that is, one that
   had turned Jew; of Symmachus, and Theodotion, both Ebionites, that is,
   most vile heretics, that they joined together with the Hebrew Original,
   and the Translation of the Seventy (as hath been before signified out
   of Epiphanius) and set them forth openly to be considered of and
   perused by all. But we weary the unlearned, who need not know so much,
   and trouble the learned, who know it already.

   Yet before we end, we must answer a third cavil and objection of theirs
   against us, for altering and amending our Translations so oft; wherein
   truly they deal hardly, and strangely with us. For to whomever was it
   imputed for a fault (by such as were wise) to go over that which he had
   done, and to amend it where he saw cause? Saint Augustine was not
   afraid to exhort S. Jerome to a Palinodia or recantation; [S. Aug.
   Epist. 9.] and doth even glory that he seeth his infirmities. [S. Aug.
   Epist. 8.] If we be sons of the Truth, we must consider what it
   speaketh, and trample upon our own credit, yea, and upon other men's
   too, if either be any way an hindrance to it. This to the cause: then
   to the persons we say, that of all men they ought to be most silent in
   this case. For what varieties have they, and what alterations have they
   made, not only of their Service books, Portesses and Breviaries, but
   also of their Latin Translation? The Service book supposed to be made
   by S. Ambrose (Officium Ambrosianum) was a great while in special use
   and request; but Pope Hadrian calling a Council with the aid of Charles
   the Emperor, abolished it, yea, burnt it, and commanded the Service
   book of Saint Gregory universally to be used. [Durand. lib. 5. cap. 2.]
   Well, Officium Gregorianum gets by this means to be in credit, but doth
   it continue without change or altering? No, the very Roman Service was
   of two fashions, the New fashion, and the Old, (the one used in one
   Church, the other in another) as is to be seen in Pamelius a Romanist,
   his Preface, before Micrologus. the same Pamelius reporteth out
   Radulphus de Rivo, that about the year of our Lord, 1277, Pope Nicolas
   the Third removed out of the Churches of Rome, the more ancient books
   (of Service) and brought into use the Missals of the Friers Minorites,
   and commanded them to be observed there; insomuch that about an hundred
   years after, when the above name Radulphus happened to be at Rome, he
   found all the books to be new, (of the new stamp). Neither were there
   this chopping and changing in the more ancient times only, but also of
   late: Pius Quintus himself confesseth, that every Bishopric almost had
   a peculiar kind of service, most unlike to that which others had: which
   moved him to abolish all other Breviaries, though never so ancient, and
   privileged and published by Bishops in their Dioceses, and to establish
   and ratify that only which was of his own setting forth, in the year
   1568. Now when the father of their Church, who gladly would heal the
   sore of the daughter of his people softly and slightly, and make the
   best of it, findeth so great fault with them for their odds and
   jarring; we hope the children have no great cause to vaunt of their
   uniformity. But the difference that appeareth between our Translations,
   and our often correcting of them, is the thing that we are specially
   charged with; let us see therefore whether they themselves be without
   fault this way, (if it be to be counted a fault, to correct) and
   whether they be fit men to throw stones at us: O tandem maior parcas
   insane minori: they that are less sound themselves, out not to object
   infirmities to others. [Horat.] If we should tell them that Valla,
   Stapulensis, Erasmus, and Vives found fault with their vulgar
   Translation, and consequently wished the same to be mended, or a new
   one to be made, they would answer peradventure, that we produced their
   enemies for witnesses against them; albeit, they were in no other sort
   enemies, than as S. Paul was to the Galatians, for telling them the
   truth [Gal 4:16]: and it were to be wished, that they had dared to tell
   it them plainlier and oftener. But what will they say to this, that
   Pope Leo the Tenth allowed Erasmus' Translation of the New Testament,
   so much different from the vulgar, by his Apostolic Letter and Bull;
   that the same Leo exhorted Pagnine to translate the whole Bible, and
   bare whatsoever charges was necessary for the work? [Sixtus Senens.]
   Surely, as the Apostle reasoneth to the Hebrews, that if the former Law
   and Testament had been sufficient, there had been no need of the
   latter: [Heb 7:11 and 8:7] so we may say, that if the old vulgar had
   been at all points allowable, to small purpose had labour and charges
   been undergone, about framing of a new. If they say, it was one Pope's
   private opinion, and that he consulted only himself; then we are able
   to go further with them, and to aver, that more of their chief men of
   all sorts, even their own Trent champions Paiva and Vega, and their own
   Inquisitors, Hieronymus ab Oleastro, and their own Bishop Isidorus
   Clarius, and their own Cardinal Thomas a Vio Caietan, do either make
   new Translations themselves, or follow new ones of other men's making,
   or note the vulgar Interpreter for halting; none of them fear to
   dissent from him, nor yet to except against him. And call they this an
   uniform tenor of text and judgment about the text, so many of their
   Worthies disclaiming the now received conceit? Nay, we will yet come
   nearer the quick: doth not their Paris edition differ from the Lovaine,
   and Hentenius his from them both, and yet all of them allowed by
   authority? Nay, doth not Sixtus Quintus confess, that certain Catholics
   (he meaneth certain of his own side) were in such an humor of
   translating the Scriptures into Latin, that Satan taking occasion by
   them, though they thought of no such matter, did strive what he could,
   out of so uncertain and manifold a variety of Translations, so to
   mingle all things, that nothing might seem to be left certain and firm
   in them, etc.? [Sixtus 5. praefat. fixa Bibliis.] Nay, further, did not
   the same Sixtus ordain by an inviolable decree, and that with the
   counsel and consent of his Cardinals, that the Latin edition of the old
   and new Testament, which the Council of Trent would have to be
   authentic, is the same without controversy which he then set forth,
   being diligently corrected and printed in the Printinghouse of Vatican?
   Thus Sixtus in his Preface before his Bible. And yet Clement the Eighth
   his immediate successor, published another edition of the Bible,
   containing in it infinite differences from that of Sixtus, (and many of
   them weighty and material) and yet this must be authentic by all means.
   What is to have the faith of our glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST with Yea or
   Nay, if this be not? Again, what is sweet harmony and consent, if this
   be? Therefore, as Demaratus of Corinth advised a great King, before he
   talked of the dissensions of the Grecians, to compose his domestic
   broils (for at that time his Queen and his son and heir were at deadly
   feud with him) so all the while that our adversaries do make so many
   and so various editions themselves, and do jar so much about the worth
   and authority of them, they can with no show of equity challenge us for
   changing and correcting.

    THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSLATORS, WITH THEIR NUMBER, FURNITURE, CARE, ETC.

   But it is high time to leave them, and to show in brief what we
   proposed to ourselves, and what course we held in this our perusal and
   survey of the Bible. Truly (good Christian Reader) we never thought
   from the beginning, that we should need to make a new Translation, nor
   yet to make of a bad one a good one, (for then the imputation of Sixtus
   had been true in some sort, that our people had been fed with gall of
   Dragons instead of wine, with whey instead of milk:) but to make a good
   one better, or out of many good ones, one principal good one, not
   justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavor, that our
   mark. To that purpose there were many chosen, that were greater in
   other men's eyes than in their own, and that sought the truth rather
   than their own praise. Again, they came or were thought to come to the
   work, not exercendi causa (as one saith) but exercitati, that is,
   learned, not to learn: For the chief overseer and [NOTE: Greek letters
   omitted] under his Majesty, to whom not only we, but also our whole
   Church was much bound, knew by his wisdom, which thing also Nazianzen
   taught so long ago, that it is a preposterous order to teach first and
   to learn after, yea that [NOTE: Greek letters omitted] to learn and
   practice together, is neither commendable for the workman, nor safe for
   the work. [Idem in Apologet.] Therefore such were thought upon, as
   could say modestly with Saint Jerome, Et Hebreaeum Sermonem ex parte
   didicimus, et in Latino pene ab ipsis incunabulis etc. detriti sumus.
   "Both we have learned the Hebrew tongue in part, and in the Latin we
   have been exercised almost from our very cradle." S. Jerome maketh no
   mention of the Greek tongue, wherein yet he did excel, because he
   translated not the old Testament out of Greek, but out of Hebrew. And
   in what sort did these assemble? In the trust of their own knowledge,
   or of their sharpness of wit, or deepness of judgment, as it were in an
   arm of flesh? At no hand. They trusted in him that hath the key of
   David, opening and no man shutting; they prayed to the Lord the Father
   of our Lord, to the effect that S. Augustine did; "O let thy Scriptures
   be my pure delight, let me not be deceived in them, neither let me
   deceive by them." [S. Aug. lib. II. Confess. cap. 2.] In this
   confidence, and with this devotion did they assemble together; not too
   many, lest one should trouble another; and yet many, lest many things
   haply might escape them. If you ask what they had before them, truly it
   was the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, the Greek of the New. These
   are the two golden pipes, or rather conduits, where-through the olive
   branches empty themselves into the gold. Saint Augustine calleth them
   precedent, or original tongues; [S. August. 3. de doctr. c. 3. etc.]
   Saint Jerome, fountains. [S. Jerome. ad Suniam et Fretel.] The same
   Saint Jerome affirmeth, [S. Jerome. ad Lucinium, Dist. 9 ut veterum.]
   and Gratian hath not spared to put it into his Decree, That "as the
   credit of the old Books" (he meaneth of the Old Testament) "is to be
   tried by the Hebrew Volumes, so of the New by the Greek tongue," he
   meaneth by the original Greek. If truth be tried by these tongues, then
   whence should a Translation be made, but out of them? These tongues
   therefore, the Scriptures we say in those tongues, we set before us to
   translate, being the tongues wherein God was pleased to speak to his
   Church by the Prophets and Apostles. Neither did we run over the work
   with that posting haste that the Septuagint did, if that be true which
   is reported of them, that they finished it in 72 days; [Joseph. Antiq.
   lib. 12.] neither were we barred or hindered from going over it again,
   having once done it, like S. Jerome, if that be true which himself
   reporteth, that he could no sooner write anything, but presently it was
   caught from him, and published, and he could not have leave to mend it:
   [S. Jerome. ad Pammac. pro libr. advers. Iovinian.] neither, to be
   short, were we the first that fell in hand with translating the
   Scripture into English, and consequently destitute of former helps, as
   it is written of Origen, that he was the first in a manner, that put
   his hand to write Commentaries upon the Scriptures, [Sophoc. in Elect.]
   and therefore no marvel, if he overshot himself many times. None of
   these things: the work hath not been huddled up in 72 days, but hath
   cost the workmen, as light as it seemeth, the pains of twice seven
   times seventy two days and more: matters of such weight and consequence
   are to be speeded with maturity: for in a business of movement a man
   feareth not the blame of convenient slackness. [S. Chrysost. in II.
   Thess. cap. 2.] Neither did we think much to consult the Translators or
   Commentators, Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek or Latin, no nor the
   Spanish, French, Italian, or Dutch; neither did we disdain to revise
   that which we had done, and to bring back to the anvil that which we
   had hammered: but having and using as great helps as were needful, and
   fearing no reproach for slowness, nor coveting praise for expedition,
   we have at length, through the good hand of the Lord upon us, brought
   the work to that pass that you see.

    REASONS MOVING US TO SET DIVERSITY OF SENSES IN THE MARGIN, WHERE THERE IS
    GREAT PROBABILITY FOR EACH

   Some peradventure would have no variety of senses to be set in the
   margin, lest the authority of the Scriptures for deciding of
   controversies by that show of uncertainty, should somewhat be shaken.
   But we hold their judgment not to be sound in this point. For though,
   "whatsoever things are necessary are manifest," as S. Chrysostom saith,
   [S. Chrysost. in II. Thess. cap. 2.] and as S. Augustine, "In those
   things that are plainly set down in the Scriptures, all such matters
   are found that concern Faith, Hope, and Charity. [S. Aug. 2. de doctr.
   Christ. cap. 9.] Yet for all that it cannot be dissembled, that partly
   to exercise and whet our wits, partly to wean the curious from the
   loathing of them for their everywhere plainness, partly also to stir up
   our devotion to crave the assistance of God's spirit by prayer, and
   lastly, that we might be forward to seek aid of our brethren by
   conference, and never scorn those that be not in all respects so
   complete as they should be, being to seek in many things ourselves, it
   hath pleased God in his divine providence, here and there to scatter
   words and sentences of that difficulty and doubtfulness, not in
   doctrinal points that concern salvation, (for in such it hath been
   vouched that the Scriptures are plain) but in matters of less moment,
   that fearfulness would better beseem us than confidence, and if we will
   resolve upon modesty with S. Augustine, (though not in this same case
   altogether, yet upon the same ground) Melius est debitare de occultis,
   quam litigare de incertis, [S. Aug li. S. de Genes. ad liter. cap. 5.]
   "it is better to make doubt of those things which are secret, than to
   strive about those things that are uncertain." There be many words in
   the Scriptures, which be never found there but once, (having neither
   brother or neighbor, as the Hebrews speak) so that we cannot be holpen
   by conference of places. Again, there be many rare names of certain
   birds, beasts and precious stones, etc. concerning the Hebrews
   themselves are so divided among themselves for judgment, that they may
   seem to have defined this or that, rather because they would say
   something, than because they were sure of that which they said, as S.
   Jerome somewhere saith of the Septuagint. Now in such a case, doth not
   a margin do well to admonish the Reader to seek further, and not to
   conclude or dogmatize upon this or that peremptorily? For as it is a
   fault of incredulity, to doubt of those things that are evident: so to
   determine of such things as the Spirit of God hath left (even in the
   judgment of the judicious) questionable, can be no less than
   presumption. Therefore as S. Augustine saith, that variety of
   Translations is profitable for the finding out of the sense of the
   Scriptures: [S. Aug. 2. De doctr. Christian. cap. 14.] so diversity of
   signification and sense in the margin, where the text is no so clear,
   must needs do good, yea, is necessary, as we are persuaded. We know
   that Sixtus Quintus expressly forbiddeth, that any variety of readings
   of their vulgar edition, should be put in the margin, [Sixtus 5. praef.
   Bibliae.] (which though it be not altogether the same thing to that we
   have in hand, yet it looketh that way) but we think he hath not all of
   his own side his favorers, for this conceit. They that are wise, had
   rather have their judgments at liberty in differences of readings, than
   to be captivated to one, when it may be the other. If they were sure
   that their high Priest had all laws shut up in his breast, as Paul the
   Second bragged, [Plat. in Paulo secundo.] and that he were as free from
   error by special privilege, as the Dictators of Rome were made by law
   inviolable, it were another matter; then his word were an Oracle, his
   opinion a decision. But the eyes of the world are now open, God be
   thanked, and have been a great while, they find that he is subject to
   the same affections and infirmities that others be, that his skin is
   penetrable, and therefore so much as he proveth, not as much as he
   claimeth, they grant and embrace.

    REASONS INDUCING US NOT TO STAND CURIOUSLY UPON AN IDENTITY OF PHRASING

   Another things we think good to admonish thee of (gentle Reader) that
   we have not tied ourselves to an uniformity of phrasing, or to an
   identity of words, as some peradventure would wish that we had done,
   because they observe, that some learned men somewhere, have been as
   exact as they could that way. Truly, that we might not vary from the
   sense of that which we had translated before, if the word signified
   that same in both places (for there be some words that be not the same
   sense everywhere) we were especially careful, and made a conscience,
   according to our duty. But, that we should express the same notion in
   the same particular word; as for example, if we translate the Hebrew or
   Greek word once by PURPOSE, never to call it INTENT; if one where
   JOURNEYING, never TRAVELING; if one where THINK, never SUPPOSE; if one
   where PAIN, never ACHE; if one where JOY, never GLADNESS, etc. Thus to
   mince the matter, we thought to savour more of curiosity than wisdom,
   and that rather it would breed scorn in the Atheist, than bring profit
   to the godly Reader. For is the kingdom of God to become words or
   syllables? why should we be in bondage to them if we may be free, use
   one precisely when we may use another no less fit, as commodiously? A
   godly Father in the Primitive time showed himself greatly moved, that
   one of newfangledness called [NOTE: Greek omitted but was a dispute
   over the word for "a bed"] [Niceph. Calist. lib.8. cap.42.] though the
   difference be little or none; and another reporteth that he was much
   abused for turning "Cucurbita" (to which reading the people had been
   used) into "Hedera". [S. Jerome in 4. Ionae. See S. Aug: epist. 10.]
   Now if this happens in better times, and upon so small occasions, we
   might justly fear hard censure, if generally we should make verbal and
   unnecessary changings. We might also be charged (by scoffers) with some
   unequal dealing towards a great number of good English words. For as it
   is written of a certain great Philosopher, that he should say , that
   those logs were happy that were made images to be worshipped; for their
   fellows, as good as they, lay for blocks behind the fire: so if we
   should say, as it were, unto certain words, Stand up higher, have a
   place in the Bible always, and to others of like quality, Get ye hence,
   be banished forever, we might be taxed peradventure with S. James his
   words, namely, "To be partial in ourselves and judges of evil
   thoughts." Add hereunto, that niceness in words was always counted the
   next step to trifling, and so was to be curious about names too: also
   that we cannot follow a better pattern for elocution than God himself;
   therefore he using divers words, in his holy writ, and indifferently
   for one thing in nature: [see Euseb. li. 12. ex Platon.] we, if we will
   not be superstitious, may use the same liberty in our English versions
   out of Hebrew and Greek, for that copy or store that he hath given us.
   Lastly, we have on the one side avoided the scrupulosity of the
   Puritans, who leave the old Ecclesiastical words, and betake them to
   other, as when they put WASHING for BAPTISM, and CONGREGATION instead
   of CHURCH: as also on the other side we have shunned the obscurity of
   the Papists, in their AZIMES, TUNIKE, RATIONAL, HOLOCAUSTS, PRAEPUCE,
   PASCHE, and a number of such like, whereof their late Translation is
   full, and that of purpose to darken the sense, that since they must
   needs translate the Bible, yet by the language thereof, it may be kept
   from being understood. But we desire that the Scripture may speak like
   itself, as in the language of Canaan, that it may be understood even of
   the very vulgar.

   Many other things we might give thee warning of (gentle Reader) if we
   had not exceeded the measure of a Preface already. It remaineth, that
   we commend thee to God, and to the Spirit of his grace, which is able
   to build further than we can ask or think. He removeth the scales from
   our eyes, the vail from our hearts, opening our wits that we may
   understand his word, enlarging our hearts, yea correcting our
   affections, that we may love it to the end. Ye are brought unto
   fountains of living water which ye digged not; do not cast earth into
   them with the Philistines, neither prefer broken pits before them with
   the wicked Jews. [Gen 26:15. Jer 2:13.] Others have laboured, and you
   may enter into their labours; O receive not so great things in vain, O
   despise not so great salvation! Be not like swine to tread under foot
   so precious things, neither yet like dogs to tear and abuse holy
   things. Say not to our Saviour with the Gergesites, Depart out of our
   coast [Matt 8:34]; neither yet with Esau sell your birthright for a
   mess of pottage [Heb 12:16]. If light be come into the world, love not
   darkness more than light; if food, if clothing be offered, go not
   naked, starve not yourselves. Remember the advice of Nazianzene, "It is
   a grievous thing" (or dangerous) "to neglect a great fair, and to seek
   to make markets afterwards: also the encouragement of S. Chrysostom,
   "It is altogether impossible, that he that is sober" (and watchful)
   "should at any time be neglected:" [S. Chrysost. in epist. ad Rom. cap.
   14. oral. 26.] Lastly, the admonition and menacing of S. Augustine,
   "They that despise God's will inviting them, shall feel God's will
   taking vengeance of them." [S. August. ad artic. sibi falso object.
   Artic. 16.] It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
   God; [Heb 10:31] but a blessed thing it is, and will bring us to
   everlasting blessedness in the end, when God speaketh unto us, to
   hearken; when he setteth his word before us, to read it; when he
   stretcheth out his hand and calleth, to answer, Here am I, here we are
   to do thy will, O God. The Lord work a care and conscience in us to
   know him and serve him, that we may be acknowledged of him at the
   appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the holy Ghost, be all
   praise and thanksgiving.

   Amen.

Genesis
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 1

   In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

   ^2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the
   face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
   waters.

   ^3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

   ^4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
   from the darkness.

   ^5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And
   the evening and the morning were the first day.

   ^6And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
   and let it divide the waters from the waters.

   ^7And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under
   the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it
   was so.

   ^8And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning
   were the second day.

   ^9And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
   unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

   ^10And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the
   waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

   ^11And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
   seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is
   in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

   ^12And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his
   kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his
   kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^13And the evening and the morning were the third day.

   ^14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to
   divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
   seasons, and for days, and years:

   ^15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give
   light upon the earth: and it was so.

   ^16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
   and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

   ^17And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon
   the earth,

   ^18And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light
   from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

   ^19And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

   ^20And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
   creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
   open firmament of heaven.

   ^21And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,
   which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every
   winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^22And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
   the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

   ^23And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

   ^24And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
   his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
   kind: and it was so.

   ^25And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after
   their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
   kind: and God saw that it was good.

   ^26And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and
   let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
   the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
   creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

   ^27So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
   him; male and female created he them.

   ^28And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
   multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
   over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
   living thing that moveth upon the earth.

   ^29And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
   which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
   is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

   ^30And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and
   to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I
   have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

   ^31And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very
   good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 2

   Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.

   ^2And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he
   rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

   ^3And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in
   it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

   ^4These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
   were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the
   heavens,

   ^5And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
   herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to
   rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.

   ^6But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face
   of the ground.

   ^7And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
   into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.

   ^8And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put
   the man whom he had formed.

   ^9And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is
   pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
   midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

   ^10And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it
   was parted, and became into four heads.

   ^11The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
   whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

   ^12And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx
   stone.

   ^13And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
   compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

   ^14And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth
   toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

   ^15And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden
   to dress it and to keep it.

   ^16And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
   garden thou mayest freely eat:

   ^17But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not
   eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
   die.

   ^18And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone;
   I will make him an help meet for him.

   ^19And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field,
   and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he
   would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that
   was the name thereof.

   ^20And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and
   to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help
   meet for him.

   ^21And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
   slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
   thereof;

   ^22And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman,
   and brought her unto the man.

   ^23And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh:
   she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

   ^24Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
   cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

   ^25And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
   ashamed.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the
   Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye
   shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

   ^2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the
   trees of the garden:

   ^3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God
   hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye
   die.

   ^4And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

   ^5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes
   shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

   ^6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
   was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise,
   she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her
   husband with her; and he did eat.

   ^7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
   naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

   ^8And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the
   cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence
   of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden.

   ^9And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

   ^10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
   because I was naked; and I hid myself.

   ^11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of
   the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

   ^12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave
   me of the tree, and I did eat.

   ^13And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
   done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

   ^14And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this,
   thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field;
   upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
   thy life:

   ^15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy
   seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
   heel.

   ^16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
   conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
   shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

   ^17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of
   thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
   saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
   sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

   ^18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou
   shalt eat the herb of the field;

   ^19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto
   the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto
   dust shalt thou return.

   ^20And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of
   all living.

   ^21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins,
   and clothed them.

   ^22And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
   know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
   of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

   ^23Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to
   till the ground from whence he was taken.

   ^24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of
   Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the
   way of the tree of life.

    Chapter 4

   And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said,
   I have gotten a man from the Lord.

   ^2And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep,
   but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

   ^3And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
   fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord.

   ^4And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the
   fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

   ^5But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was
   very wroth, and his countenance fell.

   ^6And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
   countenance fallen?

   ^7If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not
   well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and
   thou shalt rule over him.

   ^8And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they
   were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew
   him.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said,
   I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

   ^10And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood
   crieth unto me from the ground.

   ^11And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth
   to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

   ^12When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto
   thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the
   earth.

   ^13And Cain said unto the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can
   bear.

   ^14Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth;
   and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a
   vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that
   findeth me shall slay me.

   ^15And the Lord said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
   vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon
   Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

   ^16And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the
   land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

   ^17And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he
   builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his
   son, Enoch.

   ^18And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael
   begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

   ^19And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah,
   and the name of the other Zillah.

   ^20And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents,
   and of such as have cattle.

   ^21And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as
   handle the harp and organ.

   ^22And Zillah, she also bare Tubal- cain, an instructer of every
   artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.

   ^23And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye
   wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my
   wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

   ^24If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
   sevenfold.

   ^25And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his
   name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of
   Abel, whom Cain slew.

   ^26And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his
   name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.

    Chapter 5

   This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God
   created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

   ^2Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their
   name Adam, in the day when they were created.

   ^3And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his
   own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:

   ^4And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred
   years: and he begat sons and daughters:

   ^5And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years:
   and he died.

   ^6And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

   ^7And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and
   begat sons and daughters:

   ^8And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he
   died.

   ^9And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

   ^10And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
   years, and begat sons and daughters:

   ^11And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he
   died.

   ^12And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalaleel:

   ^13And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty

   ^14And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he
   died.

   ^15And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

   ^16And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty

   years: and he died.

   ^18And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:

   ^19And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat
   sons and daughters:

   ^20And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and
   he died.

   ^21And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

   ^22And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred
   years, and begat sons and daughters:

   ^23And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:

   ^24And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

   ^25And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat
   Lamech:

   ^26And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and
   two years, and begat sons and daughters:

   ^28And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:

   the Lord hath cursed.

   ^30And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five

   ^32And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and
   Japheth.

    Chapter 6

   And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the
   earth, and daughters were born unto them,

   ^2That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair;
   and they took them wives of all which they chose.

   ^3And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for
   that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty
   years.

   ^4There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that,
   when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare
   children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of
   renown.

   ^5And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and
   that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
   continually.

   ^6And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it
   grieved him at his heart.

   ^7And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the
   face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the
   fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

   ^8But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord.

   ^9These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in
   his generations, and Noah walked with God.

   ^10And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

   ^11The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with
   violence.

   ^12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all
   flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

   ^13And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for
   the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will
   destroy them with the earth.

   ^14Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark,
   and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

   ^15And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of
   the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits,
   and the height of it thirty cubits.

   ^16A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
   finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side
   thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.

   ^17And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth,
   to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven;
   and every thing that is in the earth shall die.

   ^18But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into
   the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with
   thee.

   ^19And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou
   bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male
   and female.

   ^20Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every
   creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall
   come unto thee, to keep them alive.

   ^21And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt
   gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.

   ^22Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark;
   for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.

   ^2Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and
   his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his
   female.

   ^3Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep
   seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

   ^4For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty
   days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will
   I destroy from off the face of the earth.

   ^5And Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him.

   ^6And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon
   the earth.

   ^7And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.

   ^8Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and
   of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

   ^9There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the
   female, as God had commanded Noah.

   ^10And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood
   were upon the earth.

   ^11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
   seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of
   the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.

   ^12And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

   ^13In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth,
   the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with
   them, into the ark;

   ^14They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their
   kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
   kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.

   ^15And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh,
   wherein is the breath of life.

   ^16And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God
   had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in.

   ^17And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
   increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.

   ^18And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth;
   and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

   ^19And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the
   high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.

   ^20Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
   covered.

   ^21And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
   cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon
   the earth, and every man:

   ^22All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the
   dry land, died.

   ^23And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of
   the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl
   of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only
   remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.

   ^24And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8
And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle
   that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the
   earth, and the waters asswaged;

   ^2The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
   stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

   ^3And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the
   end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

   ^4And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of
   the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

   ^5And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the
   tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the
   mountains seen.

   ^6And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the
   window of the ark which he had made:

   ^7And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the
   waters were dried up from off the earth.

   ^8Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated
   from off the face of the ground;

   ^9But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned
   unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole
   earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto
   him into the ark.

   ^10And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove
   out of the ark;

   ^11And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth
   was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated
   from off the earth.

   ^12And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which
   returned not again unto him any more.

   ^13And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the
   first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from
   off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked,
   and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

   ^14And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
   month, was the earth dried.

   ^15And God spake unto Noah, saying,

   ^16Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons'
   wives with thee.

   ^17Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all
   flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that
   creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth,
   and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

   ^18And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives
   with him:

   ^19Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever
   creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

   ^20And Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean
   beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the
   altar.

   ^21And the Lord smelled a sweet savour; and the Lord said in his heart,
   I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the
   imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again
   smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

   ^22While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat,
   and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 9

   And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and
   multiply, and replenish the earth.

   ^2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of
   the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon
   the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they
   delivered.

   ^3Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the
   green herb have I given you all things.

   ^4But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye
   not eat.

   ^5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of
   every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of
   every man's brother will I require the life of man.

   ^6Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in
   the image of God made he man.

   ^7And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the
   earth, and multiply therein.

   ^8And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

   ^9And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed
   after you;

   ^10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the
   cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out
   of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

   ^11And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh
   be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any
   more be a flood to destroy the earth.

   ^12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between
   me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual
   generations:

   ^13I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
   covenant between me and the earth.

   ^14And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that
   the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

   ^15And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and
   every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become
   a flood to destroy all flesh.

   ^16And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I
   may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living
   creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

   ^17And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I
   have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

   ^18And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and
   Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

   ^19These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth
   overspread.

   ^20And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

   ^21And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
   within his tent.

   ^22And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and
   told his two brethren without.

   ^23And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their
   shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their
   father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's
   nakedness.

   ^24And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done
   unto him.

   ^25And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be
   unto his brethren.

   ^26And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be
   his servant.

   ^27God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
   and Canaan shall be his servant.

   ^28And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

   ^29And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he
   died.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and
   Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

   ^2The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and
   Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

   ^3And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

   ^4And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

   ^5By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every
   one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

   ^6And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

   ^7And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and
   Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

   ^8And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

   ^9He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as
   Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord.

   ^10And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad,
   and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

   ^11Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the
   city Rehoboth, and Calah,

   ^12And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

   ^13And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

   ^14And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
   Caphtorim.

   ^15And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

   ^16And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

   ^17And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

   ^18And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward
   were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

   ^19And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to
   Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah,
   and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

   ^20These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
   tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

   ^21Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother
   of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

   ^22The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and
   Aram.

   ^23And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

   ^24And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

   ^25And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in
   his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.

   ^26And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

   ^27And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

   ^28And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

   ^29And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
   Joktan.

   ^30And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount
   of the east.

   ^31These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
   tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

   ^32These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,
   in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth
   after the flood.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 11

   And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

   ^2And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found
   a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

   ^3And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them
   throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

   ^4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top
   may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered
   abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

   ^5And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the
   children of men builded.

   ^6And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one
   language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained
   from them, which they have imagined to do.

   ^7Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they
   may not understand one another's speech.

   ^8So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all
   the earth: and they left off to build the city.

   ^9Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there
   confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord
   scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

   ^10These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old,
   and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

   ^11And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat
   sons and daughters.

   ^12And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

   ^13And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
   years, and begat sons and daughters.

   ^14And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

   ^15And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^16And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

   ^17And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^18And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

   ^19And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and
   begat sons and daughters.

   ^20And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

   ^21And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and
   begat sons and daughters.

   ^22And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

   ^23And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat
   sons and daughters.

   ^24And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

   ^25And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years,
   and begat sons and daughters.

   ^26And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

   ^27Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor,
   and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

   ^28And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity,
   in Ur of the Chaldees.

   ^29And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was
   Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the
   father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

   ^30But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

   ^31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's
   son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went
   forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan;
   and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

   ^32And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah
   died in Haran.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 12

   Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from
   thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew
   thee:

   ^2And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and
   make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

   ^3And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth
   thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

   ^4So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with
   him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of
   Haran.

   ^5And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all
   their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
   gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and
   into the land of Canaan they came.

   ^6And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the
   plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.

   ^7And the Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give
   this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared
   unto him.

   ^8And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and
   pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and
   there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of
   the Lord.

   ^9And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

   ^10And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt
   to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.

   ^11And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that
   he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair
   woman to look upon:

   ^12Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee,
   that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they
   will save thee alive.

   ^13Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me
   for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

   ^14And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
   Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

   ^15The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
   Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

   ^16And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
   oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,
   and camels.

   ^17And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
   because of Sarai Abram's wife.

   ^18And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done
   unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?

   ^19Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me
   to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.

   ^20And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
   away, and his wife, and all that he had.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 13

   And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had,
   and Lot with him, into the south.

   ^2And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

   ^3And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the
   place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;

   ^4Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first:
   and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.

   ^5And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and
   tents.

   ^6And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
   together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell
   together.

   ^7And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the
   herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled
   then in the land.

   ^8And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between
   me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be
   brethren.

   ^9Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee,
   from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right;
   or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

   ^10And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that
   it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and
   Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as
   thou comest unto Zoar.

   ^11Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east:
   and they separated themselves the one from the other.

   ^12Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities
   of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

   ^13But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord
   exceedingly.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him,
   Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art
   northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

   ^15For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to
   thy seed for ever.

   ^16And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man
   can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.

   ^17Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth
   of it; for I will give it unto thee.

   ^18Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of
   Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.

    Chapter 14

   And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king
   of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;

   ^2That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of
   Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the
   king of Bela, which is Zoar.

   ^3All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the
   salt sea.

   ^4Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year
   they rebelled.

   ^5And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were
   with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims
   in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

   ^6And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the
   wilderness.

   ^7And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote
   all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in
   Hazezontamar.

   ^8And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and
   the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the
   same is Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;

   ^9With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations,
   and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings
   with five.

   ^10And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of Sodom
   and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the
   mountain.

   ^11And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their
   victuals, and went their way.

   ^12And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and
   his goods, and departed.

   ^13And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for
   he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and
   brother of Aner: and these were confederate with Abram.

   ^14And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed
   his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and
   eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

   ^15And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night,
   and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand
   of Damascus.

   ^16And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
   brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

   ^17And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the
   slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were with him, at the
   valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

   ^18And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he
   was the priest of the most high God.

   ^19And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God,
   possessor of heaven and earth:

   ^20And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies
   into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

   ^21And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take
   the goods to thyself.

   ^22And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto
   the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

   ^23That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I
   will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have
   made Abram rich:

   ^24Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of
   the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take
   their portion.

    Chapter 15

   After these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision,
   saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great
   reward.

   ^2And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
   childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?

   ^3And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one
   born in my house is mine heir.

   ^4And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall
   not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels
   shall be thine heir.

   ^5And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven,
   and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto
   him, So shall thy seed be.

   ^6And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for
   righteousness.

   ^7And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of
   the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

   ^8And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?

   ^9And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she
   goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a
   turtledove, and a young pigeon.

   ^10And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and
   laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.

   ^11And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them
   away.

   ^12And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and,
   lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

   ^13And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a
   stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they
   shall afflict them four hundred years;

   ^14And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
   afterward shall they come out with great substance.

   ^15And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a
   good old age.

   ^16But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the
   iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

   ^17And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark,
   behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those
   pieces.

   ^18In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto
   thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great
   river, the river Euphrates:

   ^19The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

   ^20And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

   ^21And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the
   Jebusites.

    Chapter 16

   Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid,
   an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

   ^2And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me
   from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may
   obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

   ^3And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram
   had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband
   Abram to be his wife.

   ^4And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that
   she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

   ^5And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my
   maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was
   despised in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.

   ^6But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her
   as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled
   from her face.

   ^7And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the
   wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

   ^8And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither
   wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

   ^9And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and
   submit thyself under her hands.

   ^10And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed
   exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

   ^11And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with
   child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because
   the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

   ^12And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and
   every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all
   his brethren.

   ^13And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God
   seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth
   me?

   ^14Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is between
   Kadesh and Bered.

   ^15And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which
   Hagar bare, Ishmael.

   ^16And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael
   to Abram.

    Chapter 17

   And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to
   Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be
   thou perfect.

   ^2And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply
   thee exceedingly.

   ^3And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

   ^4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a
   father of many nations.

   ^5Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall
   be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

   ^6And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of
   thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

   ^7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed
   after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a
   God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

   ^8And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
   wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting
   possession; and I will be their God.

   ^9And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore,
   thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

   ^10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy
   seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

   ^11And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be
   a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

   ^12And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every
   man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought
   with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

   ^13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money,
   must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for
   an everlasting covenant.

   ^14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not
   circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken
   my covenant.

   ^15And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not
   call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

   ^16And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will
   bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall
   be of her.

   ^17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,
   Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall
   Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

   ^18And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

   ^19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou
   shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him
   for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

   ^20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him,
   and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve
   princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

   ^21But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear
   unto thee at this set time in the next year.

   ^22And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

   ^23And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his
   house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the
   men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in
   the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

   ^24And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised
   in the flesh of his foreskin.

   ^25And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised
   in the flesh of his foreskin.

   ^26In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

   ^27And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with
   money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

    Chapter 18

   And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in
   the tent door in the heat of the day;

   ^2And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him:
   and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed
   himself toward the ground,

   ^3And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not
   away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

   ^4Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and
   rest yourselves under the tree:

   ^5And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after
   that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And
   they said, So do, as thou hast said.

   ^6And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready
   quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the
   hearth.

   ^7And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and
   gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

   ^8And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and
   set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did
   eat.

   ^9And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,
   in the tent.

   ^10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time
   of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it
   in the tent door, which was behind him.

   ^11Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
   ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

   ^12Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old
   shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

   ^13And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
   Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

   ^14Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will
   return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a
   son.

   ^15Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he
   said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

   ^16And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
   Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

   ^17And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;

   ^18Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation,
   and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?

   ^19For I know him, that he will command his children and his household
   after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and
   judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath
   spoken of him.

   ^20And the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
   and because their sin is very grievous;

   ^21I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
   according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will
   know.

   ^22And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom:
   but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.

   ^23And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
   righteous with the wicked?

   ^24Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou
   also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are
   therein?

   ^25That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
   with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that
   be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?

   ^26And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the
   city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

   ^27And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to
   speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:

   ^28Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou
   destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there
   forty and five, I will not destroy it.

   ^29And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall
   be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.

   ^30And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will
   speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I
   will not do it, if I find thirty there.

   ^31And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
   Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I
   will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

   ^32And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but
   this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will
   not destroy it for ten's sake.

   ^33And the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with
   Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

    Chapter 19

   And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of
   Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself
   with his face toward the ground;

   ^2And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
   servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall
   rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will
   abide in the street all night.

   ^3And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
   entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake
   unleavened bread, and they did eat.

   ^4But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
   compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from
   every quarter:

   ^5And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which
   came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know
   them.

   ^6And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

   ^7And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

   ^8Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
   pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
   eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the
   shadow of my roof.

   ^9And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came
   in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse
   with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even
   Lot, and came near to break the door.

   ^10But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to
   them, and shut to the door.

   ^11And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
   blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to
   find the door.

   ^12And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law,
   and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,
   bring them out of this place:

   ^13For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen
   great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy
   it.

   ^14And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his
   daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will
   destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in
   law.

   ^15And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
   Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou
   be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

   ^16And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
   hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord
   being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him
   without the city.

   ^17And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that
   he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou
   in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

   ^18And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:

   ^19Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
   magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life;
   and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

   ^20Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:
   Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall
   live.

   ^21And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this
   thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou
   hast spoken.

   ^22Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be
   come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

   ^23The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

   ^24Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
   from the Lord out of heaven;

   ^25And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
   inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

   ^26But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of
   salt.

   ^27And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood
   before the Lord:

   ^28And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of
   the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the
   smoke of a furnace.

   ^29And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,
   that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the
   overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

   ^30And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two
   daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a
   cave, he and his two daughters.

   ^31And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and
   there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of
   all the earth:

   ^32Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
   that we may preserve seed of our father.

   ^33And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn
   went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay
   down, nor when she arose.

   ^34And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the
   younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him
   drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we
   may preserve seed of our father.

   ^35And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
   younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay
   down, nor when she arose.

   ^36Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

   ^37And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is
   the father of the Moabites unto this day.

   ^38And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi:
   the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

    Chapter 20

   And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled
   between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

   ^2And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and Abimelech
   king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

   ^3But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him,
   Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken;
   for she is a man's wife.

   ^4But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou
   slay also a righteous nation?

   ^5Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself
   said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of
   my hands have I done this.

   ^6And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in
   the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning
   against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.

   ^7Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he
   shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not,
   know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.

   ^8Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his
   servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were
   sore afraid.

   ^9Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done
   unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me
   and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought
   not to be done.

   ^10And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast
   done this thing?

   ^11And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not
   in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

   ^12And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father,
   but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

   ^13And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's
   house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew
   unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my
   brother.

   ^14And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
   womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his
   wife.

   ^15And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it
   pleaseth thee.

   ^16And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand
   pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto
   all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.

   ^17So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife,
   and his maidservants; and they bare children.

   ^18For the Lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
   Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

    Chapter 21

   And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah
   as he had spoken.

   ^2For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the
   set time of which God had spoken to him.

   ^3And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom
   Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

   ^4And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God
   had commanded him.

   ^5And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born
   unto him.

   ^6And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will
   laugh with me.

   ^7And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should
   have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age.

   ^8And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast
   the same day that Isaac was weaned.

   ^9And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto
   Abraham, mocking.

   ^10Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her
   son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even
   with Isaac.

   ^11And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his
   son.

   ^12And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
   because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah
   hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy
   seed be called.

   ^13And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because
   he is thy seed.

   ^14And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a
   bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder,
   and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the
   wilderness of Beersheba.

   ^15And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under
   one of the shrubs.

   ^16And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as
   it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child.
   And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.

   ^17And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to
   Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear
   not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.

   ^18Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make
   him a great nation.

   ^19And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went,
   and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

   ^20And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness,
   and became an archer.

   ^21And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a
   wife out of the land of Egypt.

   ^22And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the
   chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee
   in all that thou doest:

   ^23Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal
   falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: but according
   to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and
   to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

   ^24And Abraham said, I will swear.

   ^25And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which
   Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

   ^26And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither
   didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day.

   ^27And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and
   both of them made a covenant.

   ^28And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

   ^29And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs
   which thou hast set by themselves?

   ^30And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand,
   that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

   ^31Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware
   both of them.
^32Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and
   Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land
   of the Philistines.

   ^33And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the
   name of the Lord, the everlasting God.

   ^34And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 22

   And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and
   said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.

   ^2And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
   lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a
   burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

   ^3And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
   took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the
   wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of
   which God had told him.

   ^4Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place
   afar off.

   ^5And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and
   I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.

   ^6And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon
   Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they
   went both of them together.

   ^7And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he
   said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but
   where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

   ^8And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt
   offering: so they went both of them together.

   ^9And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham
   built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his
   son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

   ^10And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his
   son.

   ^11And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven, and said,
   Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

   ^12And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any
   thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast
   not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

   ^13And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a
   ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the
   ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.

   ^14And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is
   said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.

   ^15And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the
   second time,

   ^16And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou
   hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:

   ^17That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
   multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is
   upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;

   ^18And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
   because thou hast obeyed my voice.

   ^19So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went
   together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

   ^20And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham,
   saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother
   Nahor;

   ^21Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of
   Aram,

   ^22And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

   ^23And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor,
   Abraham's brother.

   ^24And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and
   Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 23

   And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the
   years of the life of Sarah.

   ^2And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of
   Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

   ^3And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of
   Heth, saying,

   ^4I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a
   buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.

   ^5And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

   ^6Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of
   our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his
   sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.

   ^7And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,
   even to the children of Heth.

   ^8And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should
   bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the
   son of Zohar,

   ^9That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in
   the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it
   me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.

   ^10And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite
   answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all
   that went in at the gate of his city, saying,

   ^11Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is
   therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give
   I it thee: bury thy dead.

   ^12And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

   ^13And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land,
   saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give
   thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.

   ^14And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

   ^15My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of
   silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.

   ^16And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the
   silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four
   hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.

   ^17And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before
   Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees
   that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were
   made sure

   ^18Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of
   Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

   ^19And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the
   field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of
   Canaan.

   ^20And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto
   Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.

    Chapter 24

   And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the Lord had blessed
   Abraham in all things.

   ^2And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
   over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:

   ^3And I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the
   God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
   daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

   ^4But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife
   unto my son Isaac.

   ^5And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
   willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again
   unto the land from whence thou camest?

   ^6And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son
   thither again.

   ^7The Lord God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and
   from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware
   unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his
   angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.

   ^8And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt
   be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.

   ^9And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,
   and sware to him concerning that matter.

   ^10And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
   departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he
   arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.

   ^11And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of
   water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to
   draw water.

   ^12And he said, O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me
   good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.

   ^13Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the
   men of the city come out to draw water:

   ^14And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let
   down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,
   Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that
   thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know
   that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.

   ^15And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
   Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of
   Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.

   ^16And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any
   man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher,
   and came up.

   ^17And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee,
   drink a little water of thy pitcher.

   ^18And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
   pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

   ^19And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water
   for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

   ^20And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
   again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.

   ^21And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the Lord
   had made his journey prosperous or not.

   ^22And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man
   took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for
   her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

   ^23And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there
   room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

   ^24And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
   Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

   ^25She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough,
   and room to lodge in.

   ^26And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the Lord.

   ^27And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hath
   not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the
   way, the Lord led me to the house of my master's brethren.

   ^28And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
   things.

   ^29And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out
   unto the man, unto the well.

   ^30And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his
   sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,
   saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,
   behold, he stood by the camels at the well.

   ^31And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the Lord; wherefore standest
   thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.

   ^32And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and
   gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet,
   and the men's feet that were with him.

   ^33And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not
   eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

   ^34And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

   ^35And the Lord hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great:
   and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and
   menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.

   ^36And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old:
   and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

   ^37And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to
   my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:

   ^38But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and
   take a wife unto my son.

   ^39And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow
   me.

   ^40And he said unto me, The Lord, before whom I walk, will send his
   angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my
   son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

   ^41Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my
   kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my
   oath.

   ^42And I came this day unto the well, and said, O Lord God of my master
   Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

   ^43Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass,
   that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give
   me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;

   ^44And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy
   camels: let the same be the woman whom the Lord hath appointed out for
   my master's son.

   ^45And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came
   forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the
   well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.

   ^46And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and
   said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she
   made the camels drink also.

   ^47And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said,
   The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I
   put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.

   ^48And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the
   Lord God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to
   take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

   ^49And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me:
   and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.

   ^50Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from
   the Lord: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

   ^51Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy
   master's son's wife, as the Lord hath spoken.

   ^52And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words,
   he worshipped the Lord, bowing himself to the earth.

   ^53And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
   and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and
   to her mother precious things.

   ^54And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and
   tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send
   me away unto my master.

   ^55And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a
   few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

   ^56And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered
   my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

   ^57And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.

   ^58And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this
   man? And she said, I will go.

   ^59And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
   Abraham's servant, and his men.

   ^60And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be
   thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the
   gate of those which hate them.

   ^61And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels,
   and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

   ^62And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in
   the south country.

   ^63And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he
   lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.

   ^64And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted
   off the camel.

   ^65For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in
   the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:
   therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

   ^66And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

   ^67And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
   Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was
   comforted after his mother's death.

    Chapter 25

   Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

   ^2And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
   Ishbak, and Shuah.

   ^3And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
   Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

   ^4And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and
   Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

   ^5And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

   ^6But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave
   gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
   eastward, unto the east country.

   ^7And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived,
   an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

   ^8Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old
   man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

   ^9And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,
   in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before
   Mamre;

   ^10The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was
   Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

   ^11And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his
   son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

   ^12Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar
   the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

   ^13And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
   according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and
   Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

   ^14And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

   ^15Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

   ^16These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their
   towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

   ^17And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
   thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was
   gathered unto his people.

   ^18And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou
   goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.

   ^19And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat
   Isaac:

   ^20And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the
   daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the
   Syrian.

   ^21And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren:
   and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

   ^22And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it
   be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord.

   ^23And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two
   manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people
   shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the
   younger.

   ^24And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were
   twins in her womb.

   ^25And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they
   called his name Esau.

   ^26And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
   Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore
   years old when she bare them.

   ^27And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
   field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

   ^28And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah
   loved Jacob.

   ^29And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
   faint:

   ^30And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red
   pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.

   ^31And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

   ^32And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit
   shall this birthright do to me?

   ^33And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he
   sold his birthright unto Jacob.

   ^34Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat
   and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his
   birthright.

    Chapter 26

   And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in
   the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
   Philistines unto Gerar.

   ^2And the Lord appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt;
   dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

   ^3Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee;
   for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and
   I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;

   ^4And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will
   give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the
   nations of the earth be blessed;

   ^5Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
   commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

   ^6And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

   ^7And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is
   my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men
   of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look
   upon.

   ^8And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
   Abimelech 
^4And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served
   them: and they continued a season in ward.

   ^5And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one
   night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the
   butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which were bound in the
   prison.

   ^6And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them,
   and, behold, they were sad.

   ^7And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward of his
   lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to day?

   ^8And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no
   interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations
   belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

   ^9And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my
   dream, behold, a vine was before me;

   ^10And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded,
   and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth
   ripe grapes:

   ^11And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed
   them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.

   ^12And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The
   three branches are three days:

   ^13Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore
   thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his
   hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.

   ^14But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness,
   I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me
   out of this house:

   ^15For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and
   here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.

   ^16When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said
   unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white
   baskets on my head:

   ^17And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for
   Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.

   ^18And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof:
   The three baskets are three days:

   ^19Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee,
   and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from
   off thee.

   ^20And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,
   that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head
   of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants.

   ^21And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he
   gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

   ^22But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.

   ^23Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

    Chapter 41

   And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:
   and, behold, he stood by the river.

   ^2And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine
   and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

   ^3And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river,
   ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the
   brink of the river.

   ^4And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
   favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

   ^5And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of
   corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

   ^6And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
   after them.

   ^7And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And
   Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

   ^8And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and
   he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
   thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
   interpret them unto Pharaoh.

   ^9Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
   faults this day:

   ^10Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
   captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

   ^11And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man
   according to the interpretation of his dream.

   ^12And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the
   captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our
   dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

   ^13And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
   restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

   ^14Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily
   out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and
   came in unto Pharaoh.

   ^15And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is
   none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou
   canst understand a dream to interpret it.

   ^16And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
   Pharaoh an answer of peace.

   ^17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the
   bank of the river:

   ^18And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
   and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

   ^19And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill
   favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt
   for badness:

   ^20And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven
   fat kine:

   ^21And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had
   eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I
   awoke.

   ^22And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
   full and good:

   ^23And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east
   wind, sprung up after them:

   ^24And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto
   the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.

   ^25And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath
   shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

   ^26The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
   seven years: the dream is one.

   ^27And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are
   seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall
   be seven years of famine.

   ^28This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is
   about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

   ^29Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the
   land of Egypt:

   ^30And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
   plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
   consume the land;

   ^31And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that
   famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

   ^32And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because
   the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

   ^33Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set
   him over the land of Egypt.

   ^34Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and
   take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
   years.

   ^35And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and
   lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the
   cities.

   ^36And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years
   of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish
   not through the famine.

   ^37And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of
   all his servants.

   ^38And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this
   is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

   ^39And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all
   this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

   ^40Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all
   my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

   ^41And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^42And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
   Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a
   gold chain about his neck;

   ^43And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they
   cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^44And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall
   no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

   ^45And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to
   wife Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On. And Joseph went
   out over all the land of Egypt.

   ^46And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
   Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went
   throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^47And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
   handfuls.

   ^48And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in
   the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the
   field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.

   ^49And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he
   left numbering; for it was without number.

   ^50And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,
   which Asenath the daughter of Poti- pherah priest of On bare unto him.

   ^51And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
   he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

   ^52And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me
   to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

   ^53And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,
   were ended.

   ^54And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had
   said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt
   there was bread.

   ^55And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
   Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
   Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

   ^56And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened
   all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed
   sore in the land of Egypt.

   ^57And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
   that the famine was so sore in all lands.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 42

   Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his
   sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

   ^2And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get
   you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not
   die.

   ^3And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

   ^4But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for
   he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

   ^5And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for
   the famine was in the land of Canaan.

   ^6And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to
   all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down
   themselves before him with their faces to the earth.

   ^7And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself
   strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them,
   Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.

   ^8And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

   ^9And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said
   unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.

   ^10And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
   servants come.

   ^11We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no
   spies.

   ^12And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye
   are come.

   ^13And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man
   in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our
   father, and one is not.

   ^14And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying,
   Ye are spies:

   ^15Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go
   forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

   ^16Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be
   kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any
   truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.

   ^17And he put them all together into ward three days.

   ^18And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I
   fear God:

   ^19If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of
   your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses:

   ^20But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be
   verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

   ^21And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our
   brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us,
   and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.

   ^22And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do
   not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold,
   also his blood is required.

   ^23And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto
   them by an interpreter.

   ^24And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to
   them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and
   bound him before their eyes.

   ^25Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore
   every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the
   way: and thus did he unto them.

   ^26And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

   ^27And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the
   inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack's mouth.

   ^28And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is
   even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid,
   saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?

   ^29And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and
   told him all that befell unto them; saying,

   ^30The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took
   us for spies of the country.

   ^31And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

   ^32We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
   youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

   ^33And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I
   know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and
   take food for the famine of your households, and be gone:

   ^34And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye
   are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your
   brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

   ^35And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every
   man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their
   father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.

   ^36And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my
   children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin
   away: all these things are against me.

   ^37And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I
   bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him
   to thee again.

   ^38And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is
   dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the
   which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the
   grave.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 43

   And the famine was sore in the land.

   ^2And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had
   brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a
   little food.

   ^3And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto
   us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

   ^4If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee
   food:

   ^5But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said
   unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.

   ^6And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the
   man whether ye had yet a brother?

   ^7And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our
   kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and
   we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly
   know that he would say, Bring your brother down?

   ^8And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we
   will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou,
   and also our little ones.

   ^9I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
   bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the
   blame for ever:

   ^10For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second
   time.

   ^11And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
   this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry
   down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and
   myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

   ^12And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought
   again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand;
   peradventure it was an oversight:

   ^13Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

   ^14And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send
   away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children,
   I am bereaved.

   ^15And the men took that present, and they took double money in their
   hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood
   before Joseph.

   ^16And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
   house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men
   shall dine with me at noon.

   ^17And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
   Joseph's house.

   ^18And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's
   house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
   sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion
   against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.

   ^19And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
   communed with him at the door of the house,

   ^20And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:

   ^21And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our
   sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our
   money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.

   ^22And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we
   cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

   ^23And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of
   your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money.
   And he brought Simeon out unto them.

   ^24And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
   water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.

   ^25And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for
   they heard that they should eat bread there.

   ^26And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in
   their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.

   ^27And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well,
   the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

   ^28And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is
   yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.

   ^29And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
   mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake
   unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.

   ^30And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother:
   and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept
   there.

   ^31And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
   said, Set on bread.

   ^32And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
   for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the
   Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an
   abomination unto the Egyptians.

   ^33And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,
   and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at
   another.

   ^34And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
   Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they
   drank, and were merry with him.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 44

   And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks
   with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his
   sack's mouth.

   ^2And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest,
   and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had
   spoken.

   ^3As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and
   their asses.

   ^4And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph
   said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost
   overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?

   ^5Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he
   divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

   ^6And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

   ^7And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God
   forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:

   ^8Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought
   again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out
   of thy lord's house silver or gold?

   ^9With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we
   also will be my lord's bondmen.

   ^10And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with
   whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.

   ^11Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and
   opened every man his sack.

   ^12And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest:
   and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

   ^13Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
   returned to the city.

   ^14And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet
   there: and they fell before him on the ground.

   ^15And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot
   ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

   ^16And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak?
   or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy
   servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with
   whom the cup is found.

   ^17And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose
   hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you
   up in peace unto your father.

   ^18Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
   servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine
   anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.

   ^19My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?

   ^20And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child
   of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is
   left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

   ^21And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I
   may set mine eyes upon him.

   ^22And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he
   should leave his father, his father would die.

   ^23And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come
   down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

   ^24And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we
   told him the words of my lord.

   ^25And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

   ^26And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us,
   then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our
   youngest brother be with us.

   ^27And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me
   two sons:

   ^28And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
   pieces; and I saw him not since:

   ^29And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall
   bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

   ^30Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be
   not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;

   ^31It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us,
   that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of
   thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

   ^32For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If
   I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for
   ever.

   ^33Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad
   a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.

   ^34For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest
   peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.

    Chapter 45

   Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by
   him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood
   no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.

   ^2And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.

   ^3And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet
   live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at
   his presence.

   ^4And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And
   they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold
   into Egypt.

   ^5Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold
   me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.

   ^6For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there
   are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest.

   ^7And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth,
   and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

   ^8So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made
   me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler
   throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^9Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy
   son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me,
   tarry not:

   ^10And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near
   unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy
   flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:

   ^11And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
   famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to
   poverty.

   ^12And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,
   that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

   ^13And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all
   that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.

   ^14And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin
   wept upon his neck.

   ^15Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after
   that his brethren talked with him.

   ^16And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's
   brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.

   ^17And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye;
   lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

   ^18And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I
   will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat
   of the land.

   ^19Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land
   of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your
   father, and come.

   ^20Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is
   yours.

   ^21And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons,
   according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for
   the way.

   ^22To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin
   he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.

   ^23And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with
   the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread
   and meat for his father by the way.

   ^24So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto
   them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

   ^25And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto
   Jacob their father,

   ^26And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over
   all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them
   not.

   ^27And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto
   them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him,
   the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

   ^28And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go
   and see him before I die.

    Chapter 46

   And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
   Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.

   ^2And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
   Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

   ^3And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down
   into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

   ^4I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring
   thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.

   ^5And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried
   Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the
   wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

   ^6And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in
   the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with
   him:

^7His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons'
   daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.

   ^8And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
   Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

   ^9And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

   ^10And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
   Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

   ^11And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

   ^12And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and
   Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of
   Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

   ^13And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron.

   ^14And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

   ^15These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram,
   with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters
   were thirty and three.

   ^16And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and
   Arodi, and Areli.

   ^17And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and
   Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel.

   ^18These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter,
   and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

   ^19The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

   ^20And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim,
   which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

   ^21And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera,
   and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

   ^22These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the
   souls were fourteen.

   ^23And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

   ^24And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

   ^25These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
   daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.

   ^26All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his
   loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and
   six;

   ^27And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
   souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were
   threescore and ten.

   ^28And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto
   Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

   ^29And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his
   father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his
   neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

   ^30And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy
   face, because thou art yet alive.

   ^31And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I
   will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my
   father's house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;

   ^32And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle;
   and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
   have.

   ^33And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall
   say, What is your occupation?

   ^34That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from
   our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may
   dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto
   the Egyptians.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 47

   Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren,
   and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out
   of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.

   ^2And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented them
   unto Pharaoh.

   ^3And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they
   said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and also our
   fathers.

   ^4They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we
   come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine
   is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy
   servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

   ^5And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren
   are come unto thee:

   ^6The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy
   father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and
   if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers
   over my cattle.

   ^7And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh:
   and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

   ^8And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

   ^9And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage
   are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the
   years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years
   of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.

   ^10And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

   ^11And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
   possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land
   of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

   ^12And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
   father's household, with bread, according to their families.

   ^13And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very
   sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by
   reason of the famine.

   ^14And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of
   Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and
   Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

   ^15And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
   Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread:
   for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth.

   ^16And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your
   cattle, if money fail.

   ^17And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them
   bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of
   the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their
   cattle for that year.

   ^18When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and
   said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that our money is
   spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left
   in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:

   ^19Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy
   us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto
   Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land
   be not desolate.

   ^20And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
   Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over
   them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

   ^21And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the
   borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

   ^22Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a
   portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which
   Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands.

   ^23Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day
   and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow
   the land.

   ^24And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the
   fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of
   the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for
   food for your little ones.

   ^25And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the
   sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

   ^26And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that
   Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests
   only, which became not Pharaoh's.

   ^27And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and
   they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly.

   ^28And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole
   age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

   ^29And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son
   Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put,
   I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with
   me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

   ^30But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
   Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as
   thou hast said.

   ^31And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed
   himself upon the bed's head.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 48

   And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold,
   thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and
   Ephraim.

   ^2And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
   thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.

   ^3And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in
   the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

   ^4And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply
   thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this
   land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.

   ^5And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee
   in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as
   Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

   ^6And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and
   shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.

   ^7And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land
   of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto
   Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is
   Bethlehem.

   ^8And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

   ^9And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath
   given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me,
   and I will bless them.

   ^10Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.
   And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
   them.

   ^11And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and,
   lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

   ^12And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed
   himself with his face to the earth.

   ^13And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's
   left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand,
   and brought them near unto him.

   ^14And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's
   head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head,
   guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.

   ^15And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham
   and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this
   day,

   ^16The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let
   my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;
   and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.

   ^17And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the
   head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand,
   to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.

   ^18And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the
   firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

   ^19And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he
   also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his
   younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a
   multitude of nations.

   ^20And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless,
   saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim
   before Manasseh.

   ^21And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with
   you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

   ^22Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which
   I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 49

   And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together,
   that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.

   ^2Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken
   unto Israel your father.

   ^3Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
   strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:

   ^4Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to
   thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.

   ^5Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their
   habitations.

   ^6O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine
   honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in
   their selfwill they digged down a wall.

   ^7Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was
   cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.

   ^8Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be
   in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down
   before thee.

   ^9Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he
   stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse
   him up?

   ^10The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between
   his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the
   people be.

   ^11Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice
   vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of
   grapes:

   ^12His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.

   ^13Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an
   haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

   ^14Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

   ^15And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant;
   and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.

   ^16Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

   ^17Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth
   the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

   ^18I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord.

   ^19Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.

   ^20Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
   dainties.

   ^21Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

   ^22Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose
   branches run over the wall:

   ^23The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:

   ^24But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made
   strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the
   shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

   ^25Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
   Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
   blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and
   of the womb:

   ^26The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my
   progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall
   be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was
   separate from his brethren.

   ^27Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the
   prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

   ^28All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their
   father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his
   blessing he blessed them.

   ^29And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my
   people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of
   Ephron the Hittite,

   ^30In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
   Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of
   Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.

   ^31There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
   Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

   ^32The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from
   the children of Heth.

   ^33And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered
   up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered
   unto his people.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 50

   And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed
   him.

   ^2And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
   father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

   ^3And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days
   of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him
   threescore and ten days.

   ^4And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the
   house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
   speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

   ^5My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have
   digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now
   therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will
   come again.

   ^6And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made
   thee swear.

   ^7And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the
   servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the
   land of Egypt,

   ^8And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's
   house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they
   left in the land of Goshen.

   ^9And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a
   very great company.

   ^10And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan,
   and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he
   made a mourning for his father seven days.

   ^11And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
   mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning
   to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim,
   which is beyond Jordan.

   ^12And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

   ^13For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in
   the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field
   for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

   ^14And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that
   went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.

   ^15And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they
   said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
   all the evil which we did unto him.

   ^16And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
   command before he died, saying,

   ^17So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass
   of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now,
   we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy
   father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

   ^18And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they
   said, Behold, we be thy servants.

   ^19And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?

   ^20But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto
   good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

   ^21Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.
   And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

   ^22And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph
   lived an hundred and ten years.

   ^23And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
   children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon
   Joseph's knees.

   ^24And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit
   you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to
   Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

   ^25And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will
   surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.

   ^26So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
   embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

   Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into
   Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

   ^2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

   ^3Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

   ^4Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

   ^5And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy
   souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

   ^6And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.

   ^7And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,
   and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled
   with them.

   ^8Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.

   ^9And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of
   Israel are more and mightier than we:

   ^10Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it
   come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto
   our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.

   ^11Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
   their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and
   Raamses.

   ^12But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.
   And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

   ^13And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:

   ^14And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and
   in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service,
   wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

   ^15And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the
   name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:

   ^16And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women,
   and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him:
   but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

   ^17But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
   commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

   ^18And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them,
   Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?

   ^19And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not
   as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the
   midwives come in unto them.

   ^20Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
   multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

   ^21And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made
   them houses.

   ^22And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born
   ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.

    Chapter 2

   And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter
   of Levi.

   ^2And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he
   was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

   ^3And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
   bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child
   therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.

   ^4And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

   ^5And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river;
   and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the
   ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

   ^6And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe
   wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the
   Hebrews' children.

   ^7Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to
   thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
   thee?

   ^8And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called
   the child's mother.

   ^9And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse
   it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the
   child, and nursed it.

   ^10And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and
   he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because
   I drew him out of the water.

   ^11And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
   went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied
   an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

   ^12And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was
   no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

   ^13And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
   strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore
   smitest thou thy fellow?

   ^14And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest
   thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and
   said, Surely this thing is known.

   ^15Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
   Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:
   and he sat down by a well.

   ^16Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew
   water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

   ^17And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and
   helped them, and watered their flock.

   ^18And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye
   are come so soon to day?

   ^19And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
   shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.

   ^20And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye
   have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

   ^21And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
   Zipporah his daughter.

   ^22And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said,
   I have been a stranger in a strange land.

   ^23And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died:
   and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they
   cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

   ^24And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with
   Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

   ^25And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto
   them.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 3

   Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of
   Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to
   the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

   ^2And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of
   the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with
   fire, and the bush was not consumed.

   ^3And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why
   the bush is not burnt.

   ^4And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto
   him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said,
   Here am I.

   ^5And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy
   feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

   ^6Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the
   God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was
   afraid to look upon God.

   ^7And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people
   which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their
   taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

   ^8And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
   and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large,
   unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and
   the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

   ^9Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto
   me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress
   them.

   ^10Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
   mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

   ^11And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,
   and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

   ^12And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a
   token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth
   the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

   ^13And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of
   Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me
   unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say
   unto them?

   ^14And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt
   thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.

   ^15And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
   children of Israel, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,
   the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is
   my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.

   ^16Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The
   Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
   appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that
   which is done to you in Egypt:

   ^17And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt
   unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites,
   and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land
   flowing with milk and honey.

   ^18And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and
   the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto
   him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go,
   we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may
   sacrifice to the Lord our God.

   ^19And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by
   a mighty hand.

   ^20And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders
   which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you
   go.

   ^21And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians:
   and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty:

   ^22But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
   sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and
   raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters;
   and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

    Chapter 4

   And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor
   hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared
   unto thee.

   ^2And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said,
   A rod.

   ^3And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and
   it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.

   ^4And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by
   the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod
   in his hand:

   ^5That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of
   Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto
   thee.

   ^6And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
   bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out,
   behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

   ^7And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
   into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it
   was turned again as his other flesh.

   ^8And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither
   hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the
   voice of the latter sign.

   ^9And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two
   signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the
   water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which
   thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.

   ^10And Moses said unto the Lord, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither
   heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow
   of speech, and of a slow tongue.

   ^11And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh
   the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord?

   ^12Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what
   thou shalt say.

   ^13And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom
   thou wilt send.

   ^14And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is
   not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And
   also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he
   will be glad in his heart.

   ^15And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I
   will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye
   shall do.

   ^16And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even
   he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him
   instead of God.

   ^17And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do
   signs.

   ^18And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said
   unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are
   in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses,
   Go in peace.

   ^19And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for
   all the men are dead which sought thy life.

   ^20And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and
   he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his
   hand.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt,
   see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in
   thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the
   people go.

   ^22And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my
   son, even my firstborn:

   ^23And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if
   thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy
   firstborn.

   ^24And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the Lord met him,
   and sought to kill him.

   ^25Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her
   son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art
   thou to me.

   ^26So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because
   of the circumcision.

   ^27And the Lord said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.
   And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.

   ^28And Moses told Aaron all the words of the Lord who had sent him, and
   all the signs which he had commanded him.

   ^29And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the
   children of Israel:

   ^30And Aaron spake all the words which the Lord had spoken unto Moses,
   and did the signs in the sight of the people.

   ^31And the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had
   visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their
   affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

    Chapter 5

   And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the
   Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto
   me in the wilderness.

   ^2And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice to
   let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go.

   ^3And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we
   pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the
   Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.

   ^4And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and
   Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.

   ^5And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye
   make them rest from their burdens.

   ^6And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
   their officers, saying,

   ^7Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore:
   let them go and gather straw for themselves.

   ^8And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall
   lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle;
   therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.

   ^9Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
   therein; and let them not regard vain words.

   ^10And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and
   they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give
   you straw.

   ^11Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your
   work shall be diminished.

   ^12So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt
   to gather stubble instead of straw.

   ^13And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your
   daily tasks, as when there was straw.

   ^14And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
   taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore
   have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to
   day, as heretofore?

   ^15Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto
   Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?

   ^16There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make
   brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine
   own people.

   ^17But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go
   and do sacrifice to the Lord.

   ^18Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you,
   yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

   ^19And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in
   evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your
   bricks of your daily task.

   ^20And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came
   forth from Pharaoh:

   ^21And they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because
   ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in
   the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.

   ^22And Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Lord, wherefore hast
   thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?

   ^23For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil
   to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 6

   Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
   Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong
   hand shall he drive them out of his land.

   ^2And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:

   ^3And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name
   of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.

   ^4And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the
   land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were
   strangers.

   ^5And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom
   the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

   ^6Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will
   bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid
   you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out
   arm, and with great judgments:

   ^7And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God:
   and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, which bringeth you out
   from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

   ^8And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did
   swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it
   you for an heritage: I am the Lord.

   ^9And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened
   not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

   ^10And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^11Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of
   Israel go out of his land.

   ^12And Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of
   Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who
   am of uncircumcised lips?

   ^13And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge
   unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
   the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

   ^14These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the
   firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the
   families of Reuben.

   ^15And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
   Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families
   of Simeon.

   ^16And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
   generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life
   of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

   ^17The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.

   ^18And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel:
   and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three
   years.

   ^19And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of
   Levi according to their generations.

   ^20And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she
   bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an
   hundred and thirty and seven years.

   ^21And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

   ^22And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

   ^23And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
   Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
   Ithamar.

   ^24And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are
   the families of the Korhites.

   ^25And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to
   wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of
   the Levites according to their families.

   ^26These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the Lord said, Bring out the
   children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.

   ^27These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out
   the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.

   ^28And it came to pass on the day when the Lord spake unto Moses in the
   land of Egypt,

   ^29That the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak thou
   unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

   ^30And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,
   and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 7

   And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh:
   and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

   ^2Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall
   speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his
   land.

   ^3And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my
   wonders in the land of Egypt.

   ^4But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
   Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
   Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

   ^5And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch forth
   mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among
   them.

   ^6And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, so did they.

   ^7And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
   years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

   ^8And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   ^9When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you:
   then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before
   Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

   ^10And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
   Lord had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and
   before his servants, and it became a serpent.

   ^11Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
   magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
   enchantments.

   ^12For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but
   Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

   ^13And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as
   the Lord had said.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
   refuseth to let the people go.

   ^15Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
   water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and
   the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.

   ^16And thou shalt say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath sent
   me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the
   wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.

   ^17Thus saith the Lord, In this thou shalt know that I am the Lord:
   behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
   which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

   ^18And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
   stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the
   river.

   ^19And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
   stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,
   upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of
   water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood
   throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in
   vessels of stone.

   ^20And Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded; and he lifted up
   the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of
   Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were
   in the river were turned to blood.

   ^21And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and
   the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was
   blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^22And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
   Lord had said.

   ^23And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his
   heart to this also.

   ^24And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
   drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

   ^25And seven days were fulfilled, after that the Lord had smitten the
   river.

    Chapter 8

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^2And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy
   borders with frogs:

   ^3And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up
   and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed,
   and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine
   ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

   ^4And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and
   upon all thy servants.

   ^5And the Lord spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine
   hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the
   ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.

   ^6And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the
   frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

   ^7And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up
   frogs upon the land of Egypt.

   ^8Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the Lord,
   that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will
   let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord.

   ^9And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for
   thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs
   from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?

   ^10And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word:
   that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God.

   ^11And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from
   thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.

   ^12And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the
   Lord because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.

   ^13And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died
   out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.

   ^14And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.

   ^15But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart,
   and hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had said.

   ^16And the Lord said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod,
   and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all
   the land of Egypt.

   ^17And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
   smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast;
   all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

   ^18And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth
   lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.

   ^19Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and
   Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the
   Lord had said.

   ^20And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto
   him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^21Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms
   of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and
   into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of
   swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

   ^22And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people
   dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest
   know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.

   ^23And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
   morrow shall this sign be.

   ^24And the Lord did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into
   the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the
   land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.

   ^25And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
   sacrifice to your God in the land.

   ^26And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the
   abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: lo, shall we
   sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will
   they not stone us?

   ^27We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to
   the Lord our God, as he shall command us.

   ^28And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the
   Lord your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away:
   intreat for me.

   ^29And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the
   Lord that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his
   servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal
   deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the
   Lord.

   ^30And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord.

   ^31And the Lord did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the
   swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people;
   there remained not one.

   ^32And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he
   let the people go.

    Chapter 9

   Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus
   saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may
   serve me.

   ^2For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

   ^3Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattle which is in the
   field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen,
   and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.

   ^4And the Lord shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle
   of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of
   Israel.

   ^5And the Lord appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the Lord shall
   do this thing in the land.

   ^6And the Lord did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of
   Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.

   ^7And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the
   Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not
   let the people go.

   ^8And the Lord said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
   ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in
   the sight of Pharaoh.

   ^9And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be
   a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout
   all the land of Egypt.

   ^10And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and
   Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking
   forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

   ^11And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils;
   for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.

   ^12And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not
   unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.

   ^13And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and
   stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the
   Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^14For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and
   upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that
   there is none like me in all the earth.

   ^15For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy
   people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.

   ^16And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew
   in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the
   earth.

   ^17As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not
   let them go?

   ^18Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
   grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation
   thereof even until now.

   ^19Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in
   the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the
   field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
   them, and they shall die.

   ^20He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh
   made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

   ^21And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and
   his cattle in the field.

   ^22And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
   heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and
   upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of
   Egypt.

   ^23And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent
   thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord
   rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

   ^24So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous,
   such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became
   a nation.

   ^25And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in
   the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
   field, and brake every tree of the field.

   ^26Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was
   there no hail.

   ^27And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto
   them, I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my
   people are wicked.

   ^28Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty
   thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no
   longer.

   ^29And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I
   will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord; and the thunder shall cease,
   neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that
   the earth is the Lord'S.

   ^30But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear
   the Lord God.

   ^31And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the
   ear, and the flax was bolled.

   ^32But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown
   up.

   ^33And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his
   hands unto the Lord: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was
   not poured upon the earth.

   ^34And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders
   were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his
   servants.

   ^35And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the
   children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 10

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened
   his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my
   signs before him:

   ^2And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's
   son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have
   done among them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord.

   ^3And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus
   saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble
   thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.

   ^4Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I
   bring the locusts into thy coast:

   ^5And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able
   to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is
   escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every
   tree which groweth for you out of the field:

   ^6And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants,
   and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy
   fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth
   unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

   ^7And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a
   snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God:
   knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

   ^8And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto
   them, Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?

   ^9And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our
   sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we
   go; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord.

   ^10And he said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let
   you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.

   ^11Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord; for that ye did
   desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

   ^12And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land
   of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt,
   and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.

   ^13And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the
   Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that
   night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.

   ^14And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in
   all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there
   were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.

   ^15For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was
   darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of
   the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green
   thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land
   of Egypt.

   ^16Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I
   have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.

   ^17Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
   intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death
   only.

   ^18And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord.

   ^19And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the
   locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust
   in all the coasts of Egypt.

   ^20But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the
   children of Israel go.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven,
   that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which
   may be felt.

   ^22And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a
   thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

   ^23They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three
   days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

   ^24And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord; only
   let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go
   with you.

   ^25And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
   offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.

   ^26Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left
   behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know
   not with what we must serve the Lord, until we come thither.

   ^27But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.

   ^28And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself,
   see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.

   ^29And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no
   more.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 11

   And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon
   Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he
   shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.

   ^2Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his
   neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and
   jewels of gold.

   ^3And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians.
   Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the
   sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.

   ^4And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight will I go out
   into the midst of Egypt:

   ^5And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
   firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the
   firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the
   firstborn of beasts.

   ^6And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such
   as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.

   ^7But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
   tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth
   put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.

   ^8And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
   themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that
   follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh
   in a great anger.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you;
   that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

   ^10And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the
   Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of
   Israel go out of his land.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 12

   And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

   ^2This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the
   first month of the year to you.

   ^3Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth
   day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according
   to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:

   ^4And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
   neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the
   souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the
   lamb.

   ^5Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye
   shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

   ^6And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month:
   and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in
   the evening.

   ^7And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts
   and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.

   ^8And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
   unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

   ^9Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire;
   his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.

   ^10And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that
   which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.

   ^11And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your
   feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is
   the Lord'S passover.

   ^12For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite
   all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against
   all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the Lord.

   ^13And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye
   are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
   shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.

   ^14And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it
   a feast to the Lord throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a
   feast by an ordinance for ever.

   ^15Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye
   shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened
   bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut
   off from Israel.

   ^16And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the
   seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
   work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that
   only may be done of you.

   ^17And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this
   selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
   therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance
   for ever.

   ^18In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye
   shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
   month at even.

   ^19Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
   whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut
   off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born
   in the land.

   ^20Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat
   unleavened bread.

   ^21Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them,
   Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the
   passover.

   ^22And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is
   in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the
   blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of
   his house until the morning.

   ^23For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he
   seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord
   will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in
   unto your houses to smite you.

   ^24And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy
   sons for ever.

   ^25And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the
   Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep
   this service.

   ^26And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you,
   What mean ye by this service?

   ^27That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord'S passover, who
   passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he
   smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the
   head and worshipped.

   ^28And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had
   commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

   ^29And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the
   firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat
   on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the
   dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

   ^30And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all
   the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a
   house where there was not one dead.

   ^31And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and
   get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel;
   and go, serve the Lord, as ye have said.

   ^32Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone;
   and bless me also.

   ^33And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send
   them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.

   ^34And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
   kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.

   ^35And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and
   they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
   and raiment:

   ^36And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians,
   so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they
   spoiled the Egyptians.

   ^37And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about
   six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.

   ^38And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds,
   even very much cattle.

   ^39And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought
   forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust
   out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for
   themselves any victual.

   ^40Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt,
   was four hundred and thirty years.

   ^41And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
   even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the Lord
   went out from the land of Egypt.

   ^42It is a night to be much observed unto the Lord for bringing them
   out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the Lord to be
   observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.

   ^43And the Lord said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the
   passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

   ^44But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast
   circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

   ^45A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

   ^46In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of
   the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone
   thereof.

   ^47All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

   ^48And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
   passover to the Lord, let all his males be circumcised, and then let
   him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the
   land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.

   ^49One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that
   sojourneth among you.

   ^50Thus did all the children of Israel; as the Lord commanded Moses and
   Aaron, so did they.

   ^51And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the Lord did bring the
   children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 13

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among
   the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

   ^3And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came
   out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand
   the Lord brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread
   be eaten.

   ^4This day came ye out in the month Abib.

   ^5And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the
   Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and
   the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land
   flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this
   month.

   ^6Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day
   shall be a feast to the Lord.

   ^7Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
   leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen
   with thee in all thy quarters.

   ^8And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because
   of that which the Lord did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.

   ^9And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
   memorial between thine eyes, that the Lord'S law may be in thy mouth:
   for with a strong hand hath the Lord brought thee out of Egypt.

   ^10Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to
   year.

   ^11And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee into the land of the
   Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it
   thee,

   ^12That thou shalt set apart unto the Lord all that openeth the matrix,
   and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males
   shall be the Lord'S.

   ^13And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if
   thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the
   firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.

   ^14And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying,
   What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the
   Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:

   ^15And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the
   Lord slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of
   man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the Lord all
   that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my
   children I redeem.

   ^16And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
   between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the Lord brought us forth
   out of Egypt.

   ^17And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God
   led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although
   that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when
   they see war, and they return to Egypt:

   ^18But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of
   the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the
   land of Egypt.

   ^19And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly
   sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye
   shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

   ^20And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in
   the edge of the wilderness.

   ^21And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead
   them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to
   go by day and night:

   ^22He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of
   fire by night, from before the people.

    Chapter 14

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before
   Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before
   it shall ye encamp by the sea.

   ^3For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in
   the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

   ^4And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them;
   and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the
   Egyptians may know that I am the Lord. And they did so.

   ^5And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart
   of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they
   said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving
   us?

   ^6And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

   ^7And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of
   Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

   ^8And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he
   pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went
   out with an high hand.

   ^9But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of
   Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by
   the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.

   ^10And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their
   eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore
   afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord.

   ^11And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt,
   hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
   dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?

   ^12Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us
   alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us
   to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.

   ^13And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see
   the salvation of the Lord, which he will shew to you to day: for the
   Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for
   ever.

   ^14The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

   ^15And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak
   unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

   ^16But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground
   through the midst of the sea.

   ^17And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they
   shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all
   his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   ^18And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten
   me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.

   ^19And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed
   and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before
   their face, and stood behind them:

   ^20And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
   Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by
   night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.

   ^21And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused
   the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the
   sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

   ^22And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the
   dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand,
   and on their left.

   ^23And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of
   the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.

   ^24And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto
   the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud,
   and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

   ^25And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so
   that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the
   Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.

   ^26And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea,
   that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots,
   and upon their horsemen.

   ^27And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
   returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians
   fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of
   the sea.

   ^28And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen,
   and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there
   remained not so much as one of them.

   ^29But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the
   sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on
   their left.

   ^30Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
   Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.

   ^31And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the
   Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and
   his servant Moses.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 15

   Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and
   spake, saying, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

   ^2The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he
   is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I
   will exalt him.

   ^3The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name.

   ^4Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen
   captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

   ^5The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.

   ^6Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power: thy right hand,
   O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

   ^7And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them
   that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed
   them as stubble.

   ^8And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,
   the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in
   the heart of the sea.

   ^9The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the
   spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my
   hand shall destroy them.

   ^10Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as
   lead in the mighty waters.

   ^11Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the gods? who is like thee,
   glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

   ^12Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

   ^13Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
   redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
   habitation.

   ^14The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the
   inhabitants of Palestina.

   ^15Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
   trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
   shall melt away.

   ^16Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm
   they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord,
   till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.

   ^17Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine
   inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to
   dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

   ^18The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

   ^19For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
   horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea
   upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
   the sea.

   ^20And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in
   her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
   dances.

   ^21And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed
   gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.

   ^22So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the
   wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and
   found no water.

   ^23And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of
   Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.

   ^24And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

   ^25And he cried unto the Lord; and the Lord shewed him a tree, which
   when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he
   made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,

   ^26And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord
   thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give
   ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of
   these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for
   I am the Lord that healeth thee.

   ^27And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
   threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 16

   And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the
   children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between
   Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their
   departing out of the land of Egypt.

   ^2And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against
   Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

   ^3And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died
   by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh
   pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us
   forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

   ^4Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven
   for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every
   day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.

   ^5And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare
   that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather
   daily.

   ^6And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even,
   then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of
   Egypt:

   ^7And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord; for that
   he heareth your murmurings against the Lord: and what are we, that ye
   murmur against us?

   ^8And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the
   evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that
   the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what
   are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord.

   ^9And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the
   children of Israel, Come near before the Lord: for he hath heard your
   murmurings.

   ^10And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of
   the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and,
   behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.

   ^11And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^12I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto
   them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall
   be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.

   ^13And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered
   the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.

   ^14And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
   wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on
   the ground.

   ^15And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It
   is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This
   is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.

   ^16This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every
   man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the
   number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his
   tents.

   ^17And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some
   less.

   ^18And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had
   nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered
   every man according to his eating.

   ^19And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

^20Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left
   of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was
   wroth with them.

   ^21And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
   eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

   ^22And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as
   much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the
   congregation came and told Moses.

   ^23And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To
   morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord: bake that which
   ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which
   remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.

   ^24And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not
   stink, neither was there any worm therein.

   ^25And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the
   Lord: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

   ^26Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the
   sabbath, in it there shall be none.

   ^27And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the
   seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

   ^28And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
   commandments and my laws?

   ^29See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he
   giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man
   in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.

   ^30So the people rested on the seventh day.

   ^31And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was
   like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made
   with honey.

   ^32And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an
   omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread
   wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth
   from the land of Egypt.

   ^33And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna
   therein, and lay it up before the Lord, to be kept for your
   generations.

   ^34As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
   Testimony, to be kept.

   ^35And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they
   came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the
   borders of the land of Canaan.

   ^36Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

Chapter 17

   And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
   wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment
   of the Lord, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the
   people to drink.

   ^2Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water
   that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me?
   wherefore do ye tempt the Lord?

   ^3And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured
   against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up
   out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?

   ^4And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, What shall I do unto this
   people? they be almost ready to stone me.

   ^5And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with
   thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the
   river, take in thine hand, and go.

   ^6Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and
   thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that
   the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of
   Israel.

   ^7And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of
   the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the
   Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us, or not?

   ^8Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

   ^9And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with
   Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of
   God in mine hand.

   ^10So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and
   Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

   ^11And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
   prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

   ^12But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under
   him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one
   on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were
   steady until the going down of the sun.

   ^13And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the
   sword.

   ^14And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book,
   and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the
   remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

   ^15And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:

   ^16For he said, Because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war
   with Amalek from generation to generation.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 18

   When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all
   that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the
   Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt;

   ^2Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after
   he had sent her back,

   ^3And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he
   said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

   ^4And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said
   he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:

   ^5And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife
   unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

   ^6And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee,
   and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

   ^7And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and
   kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came
   into the tent.

   ^8And Moses told his father in law all that the Lord had done unto
   Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail
   that had come upon them by the way, and how the Lord delivered them.

   ^9And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the Lord had done to
   Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.

   ^10And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord, who hath delivered you out of
   the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
   delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

   ^11Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods: for in the thing
   wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

   ^12And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
   sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to
   eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

   ^13And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
   people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the
   evening.

   ^14And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he
   said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest
   thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto
   even?

   ^15And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto
   me to enquire of God:

   ^16When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one
   and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.

   ^17And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is
   not good.

   ^18Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with
   thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to
   perform it thyself alone.

   ^19Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall
   be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest
   bring the causes unto God:

   ^20And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them
   the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.

   ^21Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as
   fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them,
   to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties,
   and rulers of tens:

   ^22And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that
   every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter
   they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall
   bear the burden with thee.

   ^23If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou
   shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their
   place in peace.

   ^24So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all
   that he had said.

   ^25And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over
   the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties,
   and rulers of tens.

   ^26And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they
   brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

   ^27And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his
   own land.

    Chapter 19

   In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of
   the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.

   ^2For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of
   Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped
   before the mount.

   ^3And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the
   mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell
   the children of Israel;

   ^4Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on
   eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

   ^5Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
   then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all
   the earth is mine:

   ^6And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.
   These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.

   ^7And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid
   before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him.

   ^8And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord
   hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto
   the Lord.

   ^9And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud,
   that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for
   ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord.

   ^10And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them
   to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

   ^11And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will
   come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.

   ^12And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take
   heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the

border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to
   death:

   ^13There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or
   shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the
   trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.

   ^14And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified
   the people; and they washed their clothes.

   ^15And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come
   not at your wives.

   ^16And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were
   thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the
   voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in
   the camp trembled.

   ^17And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God;
   and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

   ^18And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord
   descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
   of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

   ^19And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and
   louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.

   ^20And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount:
   and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went
   up.

   ^21And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they
   break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish.

   ^22And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord, sanctify
   themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.

   ^23And Moses said unto the Lord, The people cannot come up to mount
   Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and
   sanctify it.

   ^24And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come
   up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people
   break through to come up unto the Lord, lest he break forth upon them.

   ^25So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

    Chapter 20

   And God spake all these words, saying,

   ^2I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
   Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

   ^3Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

   ^4Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
   any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or
   that is in the water under the earth:

   ^5Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the
   Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
   upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
   hate me;

   ^6And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
   commandments.

   ^7Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the
   Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

   ^8Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

   ^9Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

   ^10But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou
   shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
   manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that
   is within thy gates:

   ^11For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
   that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed
   the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

   ^12Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
   land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.

   ^13Thou shalt not kill.

   ^14Thou shalt not commit adultery.

   ^15Thou shalt not steal.

   ^16Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

   ^17Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy
   neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox,
   nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

   ^18And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the
   noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw
   it, they removed, and stood afar off.

   ^19And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but
   let not God speak with us, lest we die.

   ^20And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove
   you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.

   ^21And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick
   darkness where God was.

   ^22And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children
   of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

   ^23Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto
   you gods of gold.

   ^24An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
   thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and
   thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee,
   and I will bless thee.

   ^25And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it
   of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted
   it.

   ^26Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
   nakedness be not discovered thereon.

    Chapter 21

   Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

   ^2If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the
   seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

   ^3If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were
   married, then his wife shall go out with him.

   ^4If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or
   daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he
   shall go out by himself.

^5And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and
   my children; I will not go out free:

   ^6Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring
   him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his
   ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.

   ^7And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go
   out as the menservants do.

   ^8If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then
   shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he
   shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.

   ^9And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her
   after the manner of daughters.

   ^10If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of
   marriage, shall he not diminish.

   ^11And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free
   without money.

   ^12He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death.

   ^13And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his hand;
   then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

   ^14But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him
   with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.

   ^15And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put
   to death.

   ^16And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in
   his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

   ^17And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put
   to death.

   ^18And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or
   with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

   ^19If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that
   smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and
   shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

   ^20And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die
   under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

   ^21Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
   punished: for he is his money.

   ^22If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart
   from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished,
   according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as
   the judges determine.

   ^23And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life,

   ^24Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

   ^25Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

   ^26And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid,
   that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

   ^27And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's
   tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

   ^28If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be
   surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the
   ox shall be quit.

   ^29But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it
   hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that
   he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner
   also shall be put to death.

   ^30If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the
   ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

   ^31Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to
   this judgment shall it be done unto him.

   ^32If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give
   unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.

   ^33And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not
   cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

   ^34The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto the
   owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

   ^35And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall
   sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead ox also they
   shall divide.

   ^36Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and
   his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the
   dead shall be his own.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 22

   If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he
   shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

   ^2If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there
   shall no blood be shed for him.

   ^3If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for
   he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be
   sold for his theft.

   ^4If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox,
   or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

   ^5If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put
   in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his
   own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make
   restitution.

   ^6If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn,
   or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith; he that
   kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

   ^7If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and
   it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, let him pay
   double.

   ^8If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be
   brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his
   neighbour's goods.

   ^9For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep,
   for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth
   to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and
   whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.

   ^10If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or
   any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man
   seeing it:

   ^11Then shall an oath of the Lord be between them both, that he hath
   not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall
   accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.

   ^12And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the
   owner thereof.

   ^13If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he
   shall not make good that which was torn.

   ^14And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die,
   the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.

   ^15But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if
   it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

   ^16And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her,
   he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

   ^17If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay
   money according to the dowry of virgins.

   ^18Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

   ^19Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

   ^20He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall
   be utterly destroyed.

   ^21Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were
   strangers in the land of Egypt.

   ^22Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

   ^23If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I
   will surely hear their cry;

   ^24And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and
   your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

   ^25If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou
   shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him
   usury.

   ^26If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt
   deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

   ^27For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
   wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto
   me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

   ^28Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.

   ^29Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of
   thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.

   ^30Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep: seven
   days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.

   ^31And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any flesh
   that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 23

   Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked
   to be an unrighteous witness.

   ^2Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou
   speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

   ^3Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

   ^4If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt
   surely bring it back to him again.

   ^5If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden,
   and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him.

   ^6Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

   ^7Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous
   slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

   ^8And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and
   perverteth the words of the righteous.

   ^9Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a
   stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

   ^10And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
   fruits thereof:

   ^11But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the
   poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field
   shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with
   thy oliveyard.

   ^12Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt
   rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy
   handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

   ^13And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make
   no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of
   thy mouth.

   ^14Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

   ^15Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
   unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed
   of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall
   appear before me empty:)

   ^16And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou
   hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the
   end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the
   field.

   ^17Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord
   GOD.

   ^18Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;
   neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

   ^19The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the
   house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's
   milk.

   ^20Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to
   bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

   ^21Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not
   pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

   ^22But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak;
   then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine
   adversaries.

   ^23For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
   Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the
   Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.

   ^24Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after
   their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break
   down their images.

   ^25And ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he shall bless thy bread,
   and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.

   ^26There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land:
   the number of thy days I will fulfil.

   ^27I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to
   whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their
   backs unto thee.

   ^28And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
   Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

   ^29I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the
   land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.

   ^30By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until
   thou be increased, and inherit the land.

   ^31And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the
   Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the
   inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out
   before thee.

   ^32Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

   ^33They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against
   me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 24

   And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab,
   and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar
   off.

   ^2And Moses alone shall come near the Lord: but they shall not come
   nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

   ^3And Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all
   the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said,
   All the words which the Lord hath said will we do.

   ^4And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the
   morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,
   according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

   ^5And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt
   offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord.

   ^6And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and half of
   the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

   ^7And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the
   people: and they said, All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be
   obedient.

   ^8And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said,
   Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you
   concerning all these words.

   ^9Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the
   elders of Israel:

   ^10And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it
   were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of
   heaven in his clearness.

   ^11And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand:
   also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

   ^12And the Lord said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be
   there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and
   commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them.

   ^13And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into
   the mount of God.

   ^14And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come
   again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man
   have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

   ^15And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.

   ^16And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud
   covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of
   the midst of the cloud.

   ^17And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on
   the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

   ^18And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the
   mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
     __________________________________________________________________

    Chapter 25

   And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   ^2Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of
   every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my
   offering.

   ^3And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and
   silver, and brass,

   ^4And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,

   ^5And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,

   ^6Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,

   ^7Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
   breastplate.

   ^8And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

   ^9According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
   tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so
   shall ye make it.

   ^10And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half
   shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
   thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

   ^11And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt
   thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.

   ^12And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the
   four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and
   two rings in the other side of it.

   ^13And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with
   gold.

   ^14And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the
   ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

   ^15The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken
   from it.

   ^16And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give
   thee.

   ^17And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
   shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
   thereof.

   ^18And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou
   make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

   ^19And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the
   other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the
   two ends thereof.

   ^20And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering
   the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to
   another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.

   ^21And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark
   thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

   ^22And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from
   above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the
   ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in
   commandment unto the children of Israel.

   ^23Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be
   the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a
   half the height thereof.

   ^24And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown
   of gold round about.

   ^25And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about,
   and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.

   ^26And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in
   the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

   ^27Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves
   to bear the table.

   ^28And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
   with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

   ^29And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and
   covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt
   thou make them.

   ^30And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

   ^31And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall
   the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his
   knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

   ^32And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches
   of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the
   candlestick out of the other side:

   ^33Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one
   branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a
   knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the
   candlestick.

   ^34And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds,
   with their knops and their flowers.

   ^35And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop
   under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
   same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the
   candlestick.

   ^36Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be
   one beaten work of pure gold.

   ^37And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light
   the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.

   ^38And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure
   gold.

   ^39Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.

   ^40And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed
   thee in the mount.

    Chapter 26

   Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine
   twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of
   cunning work shalt thou make them.

   ^2The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits, and the
   breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of the curtains shall
   have one measure.

   ^3The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other
   five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

   ^4And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain
   from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the
   uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

   ^5Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shalt
   thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the
   second; that the loops may take hold one of another.

   ^6And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the curtains
   together with the taches: and it shall be one tabernacle.

   ^7And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the
   tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

   ^8The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth of
   one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains shall be all of one
   measure.

   ^9And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
   by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of
   the tabernacle.

   ^10And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that
   is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain
   which coupleth the second.

   ^11And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into
   the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.

   ^12And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half
   curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.

   ^13And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that
   which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall
   hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to
   cover it.

   ^14And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
   and a covering above of badgers' skins.

   ^15And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
   standing up.

   ^16Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a half
   shall be the breadth of one board.

   ^17Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one against
   another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

   ^18And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on
   the south side southward.

   ^19And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards;
   two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under
   another board for his two tenons.

   ^20And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there
   shall be twenty boards:

   ^21And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and
   two sockets under another board.

   ^22And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make six
   boards.

   ^23And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the tabernacle in
   the two sides.

   ^24And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
   coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be
   for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

   ^25And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen
   sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another
   board.

   ^26And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
   one side of the tabernacle,

   ^27And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle,
   and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two
   sides westward.

   ^28And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end
   to end.

   ^29And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of
   gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with
   gold.

   ^30And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
   thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

   ^31And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
   fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it be made:

   ^32And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid
   with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the four sockets of
   silver.

   ^33And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest
   bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail
   shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy.

   ^34And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony in
   the most holy place.

   ^35And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the candlestick
   over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south:
   and thou shalt put the table on the north side.

   ^36And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue,
   and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought with
   needlework.

   ^37And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood,
   and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and thou
   shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.
